    "description": "Based on the 20th Century—an indelible brunch classic that also employs creme de cacao—the 18th century justifies its name-based subtraction exercise by substituting the traditional dry gin for Batavia Arrack, an ingredient that appropriately did hit it’s apex during the 18th century. The official spirit of Java, Batavia Arrack is similar in character to light rum, but differentiates itself with the addition or red rice during the fermentation process. It is most famously known for its use in Arrack Punch, but has seen a bit of a revival in the past decade as more and more historical spirits are resuscitated. New York cocktail mainstay, Death & Co., has shown a particular propensity for the spirit, and there is no better example to us than this recipe, which was published in their popular cocktail book of the same name.\nA true multi-season crossover, the 18th century mixes light, sunny notes from lime and arrack with more wintry, indulgent flavors like chocolate and dark fruit. The drink is creamy with a beautiful orange hue that resembles another oddbird classic: the lion's tail. It starts with a whiff of lime and sugarcane—not unlike a good daiquiri—before finishing with a big wash of chocolate that really gives the drink an extra dimension and sense of layers. Employ this drink during winter brunches or warm evenings, as it truly plays well in all seasons.\nArrack is great in this drink but not really identifiable; most drinkers who haven’t been informed will likely be asking what kind of magical rum is used. Since Arrack is primarily distilled from fermented sugarcane just like rum, this is likely to happen in many drinks that utilize it. The original recipe calls for Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, though we rarely keep that label and were just peachy with whatever was around at the time. The recipe recommends Van Oosten Batavia Arrack, which is the standard and we support, though admittedly our experience with the ingredient is limited. As with all of our drinks, we highly recommend using Tempus Fugit creme de cacao as many others are too sweet and don’t have a complex cacao flavor."

    "description": "Conceptually, the 20th Century is a triumph. Its striking name and golden hue evoke images of gilded deco monuments and lavish, confetti filled parties. Created in the 1930s, the drink takes inspiration from the 20th Century Limited train, which set a new standard of luxury. It greeted wealthy metropolitan passengers with the first example of red carpet treatment, exuding an air of exclusivity and sophistication. This cocktail captures a similar sense of modernity and opulence. In short, it tastes like new money.\nCreme de cacao is responsible for elevating this cocktail from common to lux, adding just a hint of chocolate that enriches the more traditional gin, citrus, and Lillet combo. Be warned, shelves are full of questionable chocolate liqueurs. Our choice is Tempus Fugit, offering the warmth of cocoa powder and vanilla without the saccharine qualities of alternatives. A dry gin such as Death's Door is best for maintaining balance while Lillet, a classically fashionable favorite, adds luster. The result is a sweet, silky, simple kind of fancy.\nThe original recipe, recorded in the Cafe Royal Cocktail Book, calls for two parts gin to one part each modifier. This formula benefits from a bit of tinkering. We suggest cutting back on the lemon while drizzling in a touch more gin, because that is never a bad idea."

    "description": "The 212 is a delectable cocktail in a big, beautiful, reddish-pink package. It’s a simple summer diddy that wins hearts with a kiss of bitterness and a big splash of earthy fruit. The recipe was originally conceived by Aisha Sharpe and Willy Shine of the cocktail consultancy Contemporary Cocktails, who created menus and drinks for NYC hot spots. It later found its way into the fabulous PDT Cocktail Book, and a wider distribution of eyes and tongues. The name is both a reference to Manhattan’s most popular area code as well as the ratios in the drink, which if you ask us, is pretty freaking clever.\nThe 212 is an excellent daytime sipper. Grapefruit and tequila sing together, with sweetness from agave playing nicely with the complex fruitiness of citrus. The Aperol slides in nicely, adding an extra touch of bitterness and an edge of complexity. For a long drink, it packs the surprise and sophistication of a much shorter, stronger affair.\nThe original recipe calls for an orange peel as garnish. This is a choice we can understand—the sweetness of the orange makes sense with the Aperol—but also must respectfully disagree with. The complex fragrance of grapefruit peel is the kind of daring statement we love to make, and as an added bonus, you get a longer peel. We used Cimarron tequila because it was on hand, and were happy with the results. We could imagine a blanco tequila working well, or perhaps even a mezcal. The PDT version serves this drink in a lowball, but we thought it might look dashing in something taller. If you want to prepare this drink in a highball, keep some soda water on hand to top it off, or if you are feeling spunky, make a drink and a half and ride the wave."

    "description": "This fun riff on the infamous Tom Collins was developed by Jamie Boudreau at Canon in Seattle, and later published in his book of the same name. Boudreau notes that this drink is “equally at home in front of the fireplace or the patio” and even claims the drink is “much superior to the original Tom Collins”, which is pretty bold. We agree: the After All Imperial is a fabulous multi-season cocktail, though it is most comfortable during the holidays as a fruity, bright, and stone fruit championing bubbler. Boudreau calls it a bracing drink and he's correct; the high proof apple brandy is prominent here, giving the drink a brashness that nicely compliments the tartness of lemon and wine. The finish is a spectacular bouquet of fruit— easily the strongest asset of the drink. Serve this beverage during the daytime around winter tables as a seasonal alternative to a French 75 or Tom Collins.\nThe original recipe requests Laird’s bonded apple brandy, and indeed it is the superior base here; the higher proof adds a fiery base and a degree of complexity that surpasses the straight-laced apple flavors in lower proof applejacks. A dry, fleshy calvados would work well also. We can see this drink working equally well with either apricot or peach, though we think apricot brandy has a nice seasonable bent. The drink can come out a bit sour at times, so make sure to sample before you serve. The original recipe suggests serving this in a traditional collins glass with a mint garnish. We took a few liberties and started serving the drink more like a French 75, which the recipe bears some resemblance to, and added in a rosemary garnish for an extra bit of seasonal flair. Either combination looks and tastes great, so go with your heart...or whatever is in your fridge."

    "description": "The history of the airmail has been rewritten over the last five years. In 2007, David Wondrich—one of the world’s premier cocktail historians—wrote that the drink was published in the 1949 Esquire book handbook for hosts. Coincidentally, he wrote those words for Esquire but that is really neither here nor there. He added a few additional notes about the clever name, which referenced the air mail system that was both popular and futuristic for the time, and that was that. Fast forward to 2015, when Douglas Ford pens an excellent piece on the airmail, claiming that it actually came from a 1930’s Bacardi promotional pamphlet published in Cuba. He added that the date and time rationally explains the cocktail’s name, since Cuba had just added an air mail system in 1930. This really blew our tops, because we had always thought of the airmail as a 50s drink from the United States. We searched high and low, both through the amazing vintage cuban cocktail books online catalog, as well as our own collection, but turned up nothing. Ultimately, it wasn’t a eureka page flip, but a desperate google image search that led us to the source; published in 2011, this interview with Cocktail Kingdom founder and avid Cuban pamphlet hoarder Greg Boehm seems to hold the key:\nA second interview in 2012 for Umami Mart reinforces this claim, along with the 1930’s timestamp, though you might need to go by his office for physical validation since we haven’t been able to track down an actual image of the book. As for us, we’re willing to buy into the claim. The date makes way more sense for a French 75 variation, and quite frankly, 1949 seems way too late for such a simple and delectable riff to be discovered. The airmail has all of the excellent qualities of a French 75. It is impeccably light and delicate, with the flavors of champagne acting as the strongest in the drink. The lime juice really hangs back, and the light rum takes it easy as well. It might be the ultimate brunch cocktail, as well as one of the few cocktails we would recommend with a meal, since its extra-delicate approach won’t blow your palette.\nThe airmail is scary drinkable. To paraphrase David Wondrich: “It’ll get you from point A to point B in a hurry.” The nose is all fruit from the lime and sparkling. The body is impeccably crisp and refreshing, with a wine-dominant start and light notes of rum lingering after the sip. Because of its simple and clean style, the airmail makes for a great opportunity to experiment with more complex sparkling wines. The flavors will come through; just make sure to alter the amount of simple syrup accordingly."

    "description": "Looking for a way to burn through that bottle of Angostura bitters purchased for an Old Fashioned? Well, you’re welcome. The Alabazam is a truly old school cocktail from the days when bitters concoctions served as medicinal tonics. Expat Leo Engel takes credit for the drink, dated 1878, well before bitters were relegated to increasingly subservient roles. Accustomed to drinks with one or two dashes, this unusual dose now seems fresh and innovative. We’re drinking backwards, enlivening our palates with a spicy complexity that has been snubbed for too long.\nThe Alabazam bears resemblance to a Sidecar, but the large dosage of Angostura completely alters the profile. The color changes dramatically, shifting from pale orange to a deep, juicy red. Despite fears of a bitter domination, everything meshes swimmingly. At the nose, it's all spice and citrus. Bitters and cognac combine for an earthy balance, spicing up the spirit’s fruitiness and smoothing any bitter tones. For the base, grab a good cognac such as Pierre Ferrand. If no Cointreau is on hand, Curacao is a fine alternative. Shaking all of this Angostura creates a creamy and surprisingly luxurious texture."

    "description": "The Alaska first came to prominence through the famous Savoy Cocktail Book, first published in 1930. The little bit of known arcana surrounding this drink comes from those pages: “So far as can be ascertained this delectable potion is NOT the staple diet of the Esquimaux. It was probably first thought of in South Carolina hence its name.” Esquimaux is an antiquated spelling of Eskimo, and as far as the South Carolina snippet is concerned—who knows—there is no famous person, place, or thing in South Carolina called Alaska, we can tell you that much.\nAs for the drink: it’s exquisite, possibly one of the finest published in The Savoy. The short ingredient list allows each component to shine, and the Yellow Chartreuse makes for a smart second fiddle; it hangs back and allows the gin to impress at every level. The nose is strong with juniper, backed by herbal notes from the Chartreuse. It is sweet on the tip of the tongue, followed by a strong gin presence and a pleasing burn from the high-proof ingredients. It is similar to a martini or a bijou, and reminiscent of the brisk feeling of winter turning to spring.\nDry gin pairs well with Chartreuse, and this drink is no exception. Death’s Door and Junipero, both newer gins in the dry style, but a classic like Bombay or Tanqueray would work too. Some people like a spritz of dry sherry to finish off this drink, though we’ve never thought it seemed necessary. Comprised mostly of gin and another thing as strong as gin, the Alaska is significantly stronger than a martini and most of its variations. Make sure to give it a good, long stir, frosting up the sides of the mixing glass before serving."

    "description": "Americans have long struggled to appreciate bitter flavors. Take for example, two beverages—one coffee drink and one cocktail—which share the name Americano. Just as an espresso is thinned with hot water, the cocktail weakens a bitter dose of Campari by adding soda. This has most likely been a thorn in the sides of Italians for decades. Hopefully, American palates are developing, but in the meantime the Americano serves as the perfect introduction to bitter.\nA classic aperitif, served before a meal to cleanse the palate and whet the appetite, its light effervescence is equally satisfying on a warm summer day. The vermouth tempers the Campari with its fruitiness, and together they strike a bright, bittersweet balance. Soda water transforms a potentially abrasive drink into a crisp, cooling, refresher that finishes with a clean hint of tartness from the grapefruit. The alcohol content is relatively low, meaning you can get away with sipping this drink all day.\nCampari is responsible for the drink’s bright red tone, and the method of construction can create a beautiful layering effect. Build the drink directly in a glass filled with ice to the top. Pour in the vermouth, followed by the Campari, and top with soda. Do not stir, but provide your guest with the means to do so themselves once they’ve admired your work."

    "description": "And to All a Goodnight is an audacious glass of holiday cheer created by Tim Stookey at the Presidio Social Club in San Francisco. It is an excellent execution of concept; a spirit forward holiday nightcap with all the winter warmth and spice to calm the restless anticipation of Santa’s arrival. This cranberry toned gem embraces an unusual combination of base spirits: tequila and bourbon. Tequila is an adventurous change from the holiday norm, and the result is sure to be embraced by any Manhattan lovers in your party.\nFor a drink with substantial cherry heering, this drink is very dry. The orange bitters and aforementioned heering produce a fruit forward nose, and a sweetness that sits on the middle of the tongue. Tequila punctuates the finish and partners surprisingly well with bourbon for a whack of spice that compliments the large dosage of cherry nicely. It's a balancing act reminiscent of the Remember the Maine. The orange peel garnish is not simply for aesthetics; its oils soften the bitters and base spirits. To further balance the drink’s spiciness, use a sweeter bourbon. We do recommend sticking with bourbon, rye will work, but requires additional heering. The recipe requests reposado tequila, but if you have anejo feel free to use it. This is the one time we request you be conservative with the bitters."

    "description": "The Angostura Fizz defends against malaria, or so asserts Charles H. Baker, Jr. in The Gentleman's Companion. After some digging into malaria incidence rates, we found little evidence to support such claims. Bitters have long been assigned various medicinal qualities, but I think we can all agree that the fizz's associated health benefits may be a bit exaggerated.\nOne might question this cocktail's epidermal tone, Pepto Bismol consistency, and dubious stomachic claims, but ultimately nothing can go wrong when copious amounts of Angostura bitters are involved. They give the drink a warm, spiced complexity, balanced by a touch of sweetness from grenadine and acidic lemon. Shaking the egg white and topping with soda water thin the cream and give the fizz a light and airy texture. Not only is this beverage seriously delicious, it is also surprisingly versatile. Not unlike an egg cream, it’s ideal for beating the heat, while a rich blend of baking spices could make it an exotic alternative to a holiday nog.\nIncorporating eggs into cocktails can be a messy business. Although many tricks have been suggested to achieve optimal frothiness, we prefer the dumb muscle method (i.e. shake it like hell). We recommend a workout of at least one minute. It is necessary to shake in two rounds, first with no ice, a dry shake, and second with ice. Periodically, open the shaker’s cap and release pressure if you intend to avoid a sticky explosion. For caution’s sake, use pasteurized eggs. Both packaged and fresh varieties produce comparable frothy goodness. The reward for all this hard work is a luscious, silky smooth cocktail."

    "description": "The apotheke arrives without a lot of documented history. Very few cocktail books cover it, and the only digital mentions we were able to find were either in German or Italian. The drink would have been lost to us entirely, if it were not for Melbourne’s Everleigh, which cites the 1919 Harry’s ABC of Mixing Cocktails as their source of inspiration. A base-spirit-lacking mix of fernet, creme de menthe, and sweet vermouth, this drink is described as “unapologetically rich and intense”, which immediately piqued our interest. After a round of testing we struggled to understand the archival void.\nThis equal parts cocktail manages an admirable balancing act: it delivers the best parts of each boisterous ingredient, while somehow maintaining a sophisticated balance. The nose is all mint from both creme de menthe and fernet. Mint first hits the tongue, followed by a surprisingly chocolatey flavor that really lingers. Somehow these big bold flavors tame each other and make for a shockingly good combination that reminds us a bit of the Hanky Panky. The blend feels nocturnal all the way through, and is also a potential palette killer, best suited for the end of a night.\nAs it unabashedly features fernet, apotheke is an excellent choice for those looking to experiment with one of the world’s more adventurous spirits. Fernet-Branca is the most common choice, but other spectacular variations include the slightly less abrasive R. Jelenik or Fernet Vallet. The apotheke’s success hinges on good white creme de menthe. Tempus Fugit is a superior product: complex and packed with pure, fresh mintiness and botanicals. This is the perfect time to work on improving your stirring technique; as these anything-but-subtle flavors can only benefit from a little extra time in the mixing glass."

    "description": "Chartreuse and pineapple are one of the great pairs in the kingdom of cocktail flavors, and any cocktail which uses them as bedrock will gather the attention of our ever searching eyes. The apres-ski swizzle is one such cocktail, and as we flipped through the pages of the wonderful book Easy Tiki by Chloe Frechette, the sweet smell of this combination wafted from the book and alerted us to stop our endless page turning. As the name of the book makes obvious, this cocktail begins with a basic tiki framework. From there, it cashes in on its wintry epithet by employing the aforementioned chartreuse as well as a flavorful dark Barbados rum. The cocktail was originally created by Nathan Hazard from the Coconut Club in LA and as Frechette writes: “reads like a tiki on vacation in the Alps.” Reach for it after a long day of hitting the slopes (don’t fall asleep while drinking it) or just a nice day of throwing snowballs at your friends.\nThis drink sports tons of fruity pineapple on the nose, brown sugar provided by the rum, and the sort of complex herbal notes that only chartreuse can deliver. On the sip it is tangy at first, but the tang is tempered by the caramel notes and has a dark, warm feeling. The finish is thick and viscous from the orgeat and chartreuse. It provides a delightfully decadent mouthfeel and a sweet lingering flavor that lasts long after the sip finishes. Make sure to use green chartreuse in this recipe: we tried it with yellow and—while sometimes it doesn’t matter— it matters here. If you love this one, make sure to peruse the other cocktails we’ve covered that sport this wonderful and timeless flavor combination: the chartreuse swizzle and Pago Pago Cocktail."

    "description": "This mixture has very old roots and proof is in the name: punch is the predecessor to the cocktail, while arrack is among the oldest known distilled spirits. Batavia arrack is a funky Southeast Asian spirit based on sugarcane and rice, and named for Java’s seventeenth century Dutch-colonized capital, Batavia. Colonial trade carried the spirit West, where it established itself as an essential ingredient in punch in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and eventually made its way into the seminal 1862 Bar-Tender’s Guide, which included a version of the recipe printed here. Fortunately, even in the 1887 publication, Jerry Thomas did us the favor of translating what is usually a banquet sized bowl into a recipe suitable for solo drinking.\nThis punch is light and refreshing, with the balance of a classic sour, but Arrack adds just a touch of something different: a funky, almost malty element, that really gives it a new feel. The nose is dominated by notes of sugarcane, the sip is sweet up front followed by a bit of sour, and the finish is more sugarcane funk. Those who enjoy the complexity of rhum agricole should give this a try. Although it shares much in common with other punches, the result is quite distinct from the rest of the cocktail canon, but perhaps this is more of a reflection of the limited options in the world of arrack based cocktails.\nThis recipe offers a fun exercise in old school cocktail volume conversion. As printed, the recipe originally called for one pony glass of arrack, and one wine glass of Jamaican rum. We learned the hard way that a wine glass should not be interpreted here to mean 4 ounces of rum. Using the handy table of measurements found in Imbibe, we converted the pony glass to the 1 ounce equivalent and a wine glass to 2 ounces, resulting in the recipe we’ve published here.\nBatavia Arrack van Oosten is the general go to for this recipe. When it comes to the rum, go for whatever appeals to your taste, if you want something relatively tame, avoid the high proof stuff. If you’re a fan of the funk; ignore the last statement. You can skip the messy powdered sugar and use simple syrup instead. Muddling the pineapple with the lemon juice and sweetener, before adding the liquor and shaking, enables you to really make the most of the fruit’s flavor. This drink may come out a bit strong, so sweeten to taste before serving."

    "description": "Created by Brad Farran in 2012, the recipe for the Arrack Strap comes with a note: “At some point, every Death & Co. bartender takes on Arrack.” This might be false mathematically, but the words ring true in spirit, as the book published by these bartenders comes packed with an unprecedented assortment of excellent recipes that don the resurgent spirit—none better than the wintery wonder described here. The drink—which is notably similar to the classic palmetto cocktail—works by matching the intensity of it’s Javanese base with a second base of equally whopping flavor: dark rum. These two ingredients combine for a dashing whirlwind of flavors perfect for the darker months. Loaded with notes of orange, vanilla, chocolate, and caramel, this drink is lightyears from the assorted beachfront kinfolk often associated with cane sugar spirits, and perfect for stiff drinkers who might be skeptical of them. The Campari doesn’t come through fully until the end, though it contributes a subtle bitterness throughout the drink.\nThe original recipe calls for black strap rum. This is an excellent choice, though we have found this drink to be great with any dark, flavorful variety. The recipe also specifies Van Oosten Batavia Arrack, though we don’t necessarily feel like that bottle adds a ton. If you are searching for arrack to make this recipe, that label is often the easiest to find regardless. The recipe continues to be very specific, calling for Cocchi Vermouth Di Torino and demerara syrup. For the sake of approachability, we have removed the specific request for Cocchi, but demerara syrup is easy to make and is a detail that adds to the recipe. One ingredient worth hunting down is mole bitters; they are excellent in this drink, complementing the vanilla and caramel flavors with subtle notes of chocolate. Don’t let the bitters stop you from making this drink (Angostura bitters will work fine) but seeking out a bottle is not a bad idea. Ours has gotten a lot of usage, from dressed up classics to homespun inventions."

Sometimes recipes change to appease the new taste of a population. Sometimes they change to stay competitive with other bars. Sometimes the recipe simply can’t be recalled, because the paranoid bartender refused to write it down. In the Aviation’s case, it was a more practical problem: one of its ingredients went missing.\nTwenty years ago one could order an Aviation, but it would be prepared without Creme de Violette, the thick, syrupy liqueur that lends the mix its famous hue. Making an Aviation without this stuff is like making a taco without a tortilla. It tastes fine, but isn’t the same thing. People still made the drink despite a lack of ingredients, which is a testament to its mysterious allure. We can’t blame these disappointing alterations on the sour mix era, since the omission began with the influential Savoy Cocktail Book in 1930.\nFortunately, Creme de Violette has returned to shelves, making the recipe quite accessible. Neighboring recipes like the Blue Moon aren’t very good, so plan on having the bottle for a while. Fortunately, the label is pretty and the color is attention grabbing. Most modern variations call for a half ounce of Maraschino, but that’s a lot. We settled on a quarter-ounce, making up the difference with a bit of simple syrup."

    "description": "Many a fortnight ago, “nog” referred to a style of strong beer brewed in England, while a “noggin” was a vessel used for imbibing said nog. Alternatively, some suggest the name evolved from the term “grog”. While the etymology of eggnog is open to debate, culinary anthropologists generally agree that the contemporary interpretation of holiday cheer descended from posset: a British concoction of hot milk mixed with wine or ale and enhanced with spices.\nDairy and egg-based drinks were a hit in American colonies, where cows and chickens were in no short supply. Old world spirits were replaced by the more accessible liquors of the New World, such as rum and bourbon. In the great city of Baltimore it was a tradition for young gents to call upon all of their friends on New Years day. At each home they would toast the day with a cup of eggnog: a round of drinks that—depending on the size of one's social network—could be particularly difficult to finish.\nBaltimore Eggnog employs a deliciously dysfunctional family of spirits: madeira, brandy, and rum. The caramelly dark rum, nutty brandy, fruity wine, and spicy nutmeg liven up the luxurious dairy base for a merry explosion of holiday flavor. Feel free to play around with the wine; sherry or madeira are fairly interchangeable, but select a dry variety. In a pinch, dry vermouth is an acceptable alternative. This drink is milkier than custardy nogs. For a richer texture you could skip the whole milk and use entirely half and half. A punch bowl full of cloudy nog may be picturesque for grand soirees, but when serving a smaller crowd, the convenience of mixing an individual serving is unbeatable."

    "description": "References to the bamboo most often cite the 1908 edition of Bill Boothby’s The World’s Drinks and How to Mix Them. Boothby attributes the drink to german-born, west-coast bartender Louis Eppinger. In his book Imbibe!, David Wondrich pens a beautiful history of Eppinger and his tireless construction of the Yokohama Grand Hotel—specifically it’s food and beverage programs—from which this cocktail purportedly arose between the years of 1890 and 1907. He also injects a bit of mystery into the subject, noting that a similar drink, called the Boston bamboo, was already in print by 1893, only three years after Eppinger took over the Grand. Whether Eppinger actually invented this cocktail seems to be an unsolved mystery: one of many from an era where the speed of change in the cocktail universe greatly outpaced the attention it received from publishers and historians.\nThe bamboo is complex and flexible like a Manhattan, yet light and fruity like an Americano. This allows it to shine as a low-alcohol daytime sipper while moonlighting as a dark and spicy evening drink. It is unequivocally juicy, with raisiny fruit and citrus on the nose, followed by even more fruit and tanginess in the sip. The drink is a deep, dark red, and has the look of a rich glass of Burgundy or merlot. The bamboo sports a very similar ingredient list to the old hickory, which also uses dry vermouth and orange bitters, and similarly eschews a base spirit. That said, the old hickory uses sweet vermouth instead of sherry and tastes very different; it’s a testimony to the power of those ingredients.\nBecause the original recipe requests dry vermouth and sherry without being specific about what kinds, the bamboo is very open minded. Wondrich recommends either a fino or amontillado sherry, while Jim Meehan, in his Bartender Manual recommends the rarer palo cortado variety. We like amontillado, and have even had some luck with port, but the style you use will probably be influenced by the style of vermouth you choose, which can also vary. Meehan likes the sweeter vermouth blanc in the recipe. He notes that most recipes from this era taste better with this style, likely because french vermouth was sweeter when these drinks were made. We tend to agree in this instance. Dry vermouth will add an intense, slightly bitter finish to the drink; this might be your thing, but for most it will not. If you do choose a dry vermouth, opt for a sweeter sherry to help balance things out."

    "description": "The bee’s knees may be the ultimate prohibition-era cocktail. It fits in snugly amongst speakeasy classics like the last word and aviation, and has all the compositional hallmarks of an early 20th century tippler: a creative sweetener, a gin base, and—most importantly—the addition of citrus. What separates this drink from it’s flapper beloved brethren is it’s unabashedly of the era name. The term bee’s knees is American slang—traceable back to at least 1923—and was part of a generally weird fad involving rhyming and animals. The slang also helps date this mysterious cocktail, which first hit print in 1934’s World Drinks and How To Mix Them.\nUnlike many drinks from the speakeasy era, the bee’s knees is dead simple. It requires almost nothing in the way of a bar—minus a bottle of gin, half a lemon, and bit of honey. It reminds us of other great sours like the sidecar and the daiquiri, though honestly it might be even more accessible than those. The drink itself is lemony fresh, with a nose somewhat reminiscent of Pledge (in a good way, we promise) followed by bright and sweet honey on the body, before ending with a prominent gin finish. It’s perfect for sunny days and springy vibes, when the bees are out and buzzing (or hypothetically buzzing, since you might not be within an hour’s drive of wildflowers).\nMost versions of this recipe call for dry gin, but we think it is better with an Old Tom. The smoother, more complex profile makes for a really satisfying drink. To compensate for the sweeter gin, we knock off a quarter ounce of honey syrup. If you want to stick with dry gin (which is perfectly fine) make sure to add an extra quarter ounce of syrup. If you choose the Old Tom route, Ransom or Barr Hill are great options; if you opt for a dry, we really like Death’s Door. If you want to get really sassy, an herbal garnish like basil or thyme makes for an impressive finish."

    "description": "The chain goes like this: in the late 20’s, an unknown bartender created a riff on the famous Negroni cocktail. The drink substituted French vermouth for Italian, and therefore earned a French name: Lucien Gaudin, who was a French fencer at the apex of his fame. This cocktail would be revived by Ted Haigh in his now infamous book Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails,which would be the precursor to yet another riff, this time on the Gaudin, by Jack McGarry in the 2015 book The Negroni. This second-generation riff was named the Belfast Bastard, which is a touch funny since the recipe continues the French push by employing pamplemousse rose but—for reasons that aren’t documented or easy to explain—does a hard right in the naming department and opts for the capital of Northern Ireland.\nWeird naming choices aside, this recipe offers a fabulous alternative to the classic Negroni and an excellent opportunity to experiment with pamplemousse liqueur, a liqueur that can sometimes be difficult to find a home for in the cocktail world. The flavor is metaphorically equivalent to being slapped around by an enormous grapefruit peel: grassy, oily, and earthy. The thick, viscous liqueurs combine for a strong, creamy drink that feels like a deconstructed version of its predecessors. On first sip, we waxed poetic, claiming it tasted like the “ghost” of a Negroni; all of the quintessential constructs were there, but they were created by different ingredients. We like Gran Classico a lot in this drink, as the drink is packed with bold flavors that stand up to the hyper-bitter’s boisterous personality. For gin, we opt for a dry, lemon-first option like Benham's. Herbal gins will not do as well here as they will conflict with the strong citrus peel flavors. The original recipe directs to serve the cocktail naked, but we rarely pass up the opportunity for a grapefruit peel garnish."

    "description": "Add some rum to a Sidecar, forego the sugared rim, and call it a Between the Sheets. How this became one of the earliest examples of mixing base spirits is hard to understand, especially since even today adding rum to cognac seems out of left field. Perhaps it was a bartender’s brazen solution to a rum surplus, or a thrifty way to supplement pricy cognac with something less expensive. Quite possibly, it was a logical bridging of two well established sours, the cognac Sidecar and the rum based Daiquiri.\nWhatever the inspiration, the results far exceed expectations. Swapping a portion of the classic’s cognac adds a bit of strength without compromising smoothness. Light rum will compliment but not compete with the rich, nutty cognac, and welcomes its old friend citrus. Save on the rum and splurge on the cognac. Plantation 3 Stars white rum is smooth and affordable while our go to Cognac is Pierre Ferrand. This well rounded sidestep from a comfortable familiar is an easy way to dip your toes in something new. It is equally suited to those who think they know what they like and those who are willing to learn."

    "description": "The Bijou is a very old cocktail. It first appeared in Harry Johnsons Bartenders Manual, a cocktail book nearly as old as the idea of cocktail books. It contains old timey gems such as the White Plush, which has no measurements and instructs the bartender to pour milk into a customer's glass of whiskey. Johnson, a famous braggart, claims to have printed the first edition in 1860, making his cocktail book the first ever published in the United States. Unfortunately, that fabled edition has never been found. The first known edition does have “new and improved” in the title, but it wouldn’t be out of character for him to make that part up.\nThe Bijou found its way into the 1900 edition, twelve years removed from its predecessor, so the drink likely rose to prominence, or at least to Johnson’s attention, during that time frame. Harry’s old compendium is full of curious drinks—some tastier sounding than others—but the Bijou is a good one, and a great way to enjoy Chartreuse in a simple, spirit-forward manner.\nBijou means “Jewel” in french, named for the stone’s beautiful color and consistency. Accordingly, it should not be shaken. The original recipe in The Bartenders Manual calls for equal parts gin, vermouth, and Chartreuse. If that sounds too sweet, that’s because it is. Curiously, the version listed in the 1937 Waldorf Astoria Barbook calls for only Sweet Vermouth, Grand Marnier, and orange bitters, which sounds even sweeter, and kind of gross. The best and most modern variation is printed here, which takes the original recipe, and doubles the ratio of Gin to sweetener. Garnish with a lemon peel or a maraschino cherry, or do as listed in Johnson’s original recipe and use both."

    "description": "At this point, it’s rare that we are served a drink and cannot guess at least some of its contents. But bartender Chris Good of Seattle’s Canon has concocted a nocturnal little drink that we consider a true stumper. The Black Betty is a complex mix of flavors that don’t distinctly separate on the palate, instead melding into a mysteriously smooth package of rum, fernet, sherry, and amaro montenegro. The nose is full of amaro and dark bitter fernet, delivering menthol and orange aromas. The sip is almost caramelly, with hints of raisiny fruit from sherry, giving way to dark funky rum and black licorice notes on the finish. Similar to the scorched earth, the result is spirit forward while not solely a love song to the base spirit.\nThere are many drinks that are very delicate, this is not one of them; the drink is so bold and complex that it seems hard to mess up, so feel free to experiment. In place of the more common Branca we used Fernet-Vallet, a better role player as its smoother, sweeter flavor blends well without taking over the drink. The original recipe calls for sherry, but port is a nice alternative and we used madeira to great effect. There’s room for creativity with rum as well; a funkier agricole, Martinique struck a nice balance with the smoother fernet. If feeling particularly fancy, you can follow Canon’s advice and flame the orange oils, or if you’re lazy like us, you can express the oils and put a big ole peel in to get ample orange vibes."

    "description": "Beer cocktails can be gimmicky. At best, they are well-intended attempts to awkwardly work with an exciting new bottle; at worst, they are recipes bent into weird shapes to appeal to a beer drinking crowd. The black flip, created by Jim Meehan for the PDT cocktail menu in the winter of 2007 and published in his new and awesome Meehan’s Bartender’s Manual, doesn’t feel gimmicky in the slightest. In fact, the chocolate stout included in this recipe might be the perfect complementary ingredient for the drink: a true team player. In his book, Meehan notes that the recipe was inspired by a chapter on eighteenth century flips in the book And a Bottle of Rum. This statement makes sense, as the recipe contains all the snowy hallmarks of a modern flip, plus beer. Egg provides structure and texture, rum brings the caramel, beer brings the chocolate, and the nutmeg tops it off with perfect wintery spice. It is everything you want in a decadent cold weather cocktail: big, bold, with lots of comforting flavors.\nIt is worth mentioning how very specific Meehan is about the ingredients in this recipe. He requests both Cruzan black strap rum and Brooklyn Brewery black chocolate stout, stating that while he has made the drink successfully with several beers, one will “need to stick with these products for authenticity.” That said, if forced to choose between exactitude and not having this drink, please make the drink. If you are worried about authenticity, just remind yourself that nobody used ice in the 1700’s anyway. We have made it with several different styles of dark beer and it has been consistently excellent. This is also a great opportunity to break out your sweetest, most confectionary dark rum. The amount of demerara syrup requested in this drink seems like a lot, but do not stray: it is the right amount."

    "description": "The Black Manhattan is a dark, bittersweet riff on the traditional rye based classic. Bartender Todd Smith’s creation employs dark, herbal amaro in place of sweet vermouth; a simple swap that delivers a major impact, adding depth and complexity of flavor. The drink’s simplicity combined with amaro’s digestif quality make it an ideal after-dinner or wind-down beverage that’s sure to satisfy Manhattan and amaro fans alike.\nThe Black Manhattan is surprisingly light given its use of strong ingredients. The nose is similar to the traditional Manhattan, with notes of cherry and rye. It’s smooth on the sip, followed by a big blast of amaro and a finish full of whiskey accompanied by lingering aromatic spice. The overall result is more herbal and less fruity than its New York relative—in fact the herbal element is more reminiscent of a Monte Carlo (which is basically a Manhattan with Benedictine), with amaro standing in place of Benedictine.\nIf you want your Black Manhattan to truly be black, use Amaro Averna or CioCiaro. However, we can never resist an opportunity to work with the chocolatey delicious Montenegro, which is always on our bar. While rye delivers a spicier drink, and rings true to the original recipe, bourbon lends a smooth sweetness, which may appeal to certain palates. When it comes to bitters, we particularly like richly spiced Bitter Truth aromatics here; when combined with a chocolatey amaro and orange bitters, it’s a must try."

    "description": "The Blood and Sand borrows its name from the 1922 film, and its allure from the leading man and biggest sex symbol of silent film, Rudolph Valentino. At the films conclusion the star lies bleeding on the sand of the bullfighting ring (oh what’s that, you thought you might watch it, well too bad). Blood? Sand? There must be some sort of dark metaphor here.\nIf the cocktail’s color represents blood, then the drink’s unorthodox choice of Scotch is the sand. The recipe may read a bit lackluster, but the crowd pleasing result is smooth, juicy, and drinkable. To fit the theme, create a superior crimson hue with blood oranges. If this tweak is a bit too sweet, go ahead and add Scotch to taste. Alternatively, finish with something peaty, like a single malt or smoky blend such as Peat Monster. Add up to ⅛ oz for a smoky, sweet experience. Almost swoon worthy.\nTo add some dramatic flare, as any good theatrically-themed drink deserves, make sure to flame the orange peel. Start with fresh citrus. Fruit’s skin dries out as it ages, losing the flammable oils. Cut a strip of peel. Don’t worry if a bit of pith remains, thicker is easier to handle. Light a match, or frankly a lighter if unconcerned with image, holding it a few inches above the drink. Bring the peel near the flame, then twist and squeeze strongly to release its oils. The oils should ignite, creating a small flare. Finish by rubbing the rim with the peel, then drop it in the drink. Whether this trick alters flavor is questionable, but this bit of showmanship is certain to impress."

    "description": "Legendary poet and famed scotsman Robert Burns, Bard of Ayrshire, unofficial perma-laureate of Scotland, and unabashed lover of peat, would not have approved of being called “Bobby”, and he certainly, under no circumstances, would have approved of this cocktail—or any cocktail—for that matter. In fact, “Bobby” is an American nickname; the folks of Great Britain would have opted for “Rabbie” or something similar. And yet there is something unequivocally audacious about the Bobby Burns: a cocktail that takes a famed scribe, degrades his favorite spirit with various fixings, then pats him on the bum and calls him “Bobby”. Like the history of the cocktail, it’s perfectly arrogant.\nA glimpse into this cocktail's murky past comes from two oft-cited sentences in The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book of the 1930’s, which suggest it was not named after the mythical writer, but instead a humble cigar salesman. Two versions of this cocktail went into print around the same time: the aforementioned Waldorf recipe, which goes by the name Robert Burns and requests a dash of absinthe and two dashes of orange bitters, and a second recipe printed in The Savoy Cocktail Book, which opts for the less formal moniker, and requests two dashes of Benedictine instead.\nWe’ve always believed that two is better than one, especially when it involves Absinthe and Benedictine, so we’ve opted for both. After all: who are we to split hairs? When paired with a blended Scotch, these two make for a deep and invigorating flavor profile, and we certainly don’t mind the striking similarity to another favorite: the Cocktail à la Louisiane. The idea came from a contemporary rendition served at The Waldorf in New York, so we aren't totally insane. If you are a fan of simplicity, or just worried about mucking up a particularly peaty scotch with Absinthe, then skip it. You’ll be just as happy. Stir this one in a mixing glass over cracked ice until the sides are frosty, and strain into a cocktail glass. Most versions of this cocktail don’t request a garnish, and with scotch, that isn’t a bad idea. When no garnish is requested, we’ll sometimes reach for a small lemon twist: it has a light touch and a nice visual presence, but this suggestion is thoroughly optional."

    "description": "The Boulevardier is a prohibition era cocktail created to satisfy the tastes of Americans in Paris. Teetotalism sent many across the pond, introducing continental ingredients to American mixologists. This recipe could be an Americanized Negroni or a Europeanized Manhattan, depending on interpretation. The Boulevardier relies on the common trio of liquor, bitter, and vermouth. It combines these ingredients with equal success, but doesn’t seem to get the same love as its siblings. This is a shame, as it offers the best of two worlds, and is sure to please fans of each.\nThe Boulevardier enlivens American bourbon with the distinctly European Campari. Like its Italian relative, this was originally an equal parts cocktail. It has become common practice to bump up the whiskey, better balancing the intensity of its bitter companion. A spicy, high proof bourbon would probably be robust enough to work with the original ratio. Regardless, the base spirit imparts a richness that amplifies the bittersweet balance of Campari and Vermouth, resulting in a smooth autumnal alternative to the Negroni, or a Manhattan with an earthier complexity.\nThe garnish is a matter of preference. A lemon peel adds a clean hint of acidity, and is a nice color contrast in a sea of red. An orange wedge fits the Negroni angle, and looks pretty balancing on the edge of a coupe. For a sweeter choice, the Manhattan fan will feel most at home with a cherry."

    "description": "Created in the 1980s by London bartender Dick Bradsell, this is one of a few drinks that falls into the modern classic category. Built with a classic method for balancing flavors—found in the likes of the daiquiri and Margarita—the bramble is basically a gin sour with blackberry liqueur. After making its way across the pond, the formula was freshened up with the substitution of muddled fresh blackberries. This whole fruit method has subsequently been embraced by many modern bars, including The Everleigh, who provided the recipe printed here in their 2017 A Spot at the Bar\nSeasonal berries deliver an impressive dose of color and flavor in this cocktail. They lend a summery quality, yet deliver a striking aesthetic; a velvety purple tone gives it a moody, baroque, almost painterly quality. This allows it to shine as a fresh daytime sipper while moonlighting as an elegant evening drink. Gin is immediately present on both the nose and first sip, followed by a balanced tartness from the fruit, before ending with lemon and gin on the finish. The result strikes a balance of sweet, tart, herbaceous, and fruity; similar to a cobbler in fruitiness and texture.\nAn element of the drink’s success is its simplicity. It requires almost nothing in the way of a bar—minus a bottle of gin, fruit, and sweetener. Blackberries are ready for picking between June and August, depending on location, so take advantage of what’s available. For a bit of contrast against the aubergine canvas, mint would be a nice addition as garnish. Benham’s gin is near ideal here, with its strong complementary flavor of lemon. Building the drink over crushed ice is key to avoiding an overly sweet result. As you build the drink make sure to swirl the gin vigorously or you’ll be overwhelmed by the spirit up front."

    "description": "Traveling by train in the early 1900s was a messy business. The ash from coal would cake unfortunate passengers like pieces of overdone barbecue. The Lackawanna rail company, which made the majority of its money shipping cleaner-burning Anthracite coal from its Pocono mines, created an ad campaign to increase demand. It revolved around the character Phoebe Snow, whose confidence in Anthracite was so profound she would make her commutes decked out in 100% fancy white clothes. In a column from 1929, Walter Winchell explains that the Alexander, a popular drink at the time, was created by bartender Tony Alexander for a dinner celebrating the success of Ms. Snow’s ad campaign. Mr. Alexander wanted a drink that resembled the character’s unsoiled clothing, so he mixed something with a thick white hue and named it after himself. While the Lackawanna story is compelling, it may have been fabricated by Winchell to rebuff New York Magazine writer Alexander Woollcott, a theatre critic who frequently claimed the cocktail was named after him. The earliest known printed version of a Brandy Alexander can be found in Hugo Ensslin’s 1916 book Recipes for Mixed Drinks, alongside the original Alexander.\nThe holidays are not short on decadent drinks, but the Brandy Alexander has become a favorite in our book because of its directness. This drink is about chocolate and cream, and doesn’t really bother with much else. Brandy makes a brief appearance at the end, and nutmeg is awesome as usual, but the priorities of this recipe are clear. On the nose, it offers a decadent whiff of nutmeg and chocolate. On the tongue, it is basically all chocolate all the time, before finishing with a splash of fiery brandy. It’s a beautiful off-white color with a nice, frothy head. It shares similarities with several other creamy holiday drinks including Baltimore Eggnog, milk punch, and one of our in-house favorites: the stardust.\nDepending on your audience, different levels of booziness may be employed. The classic formulation uses equal parts, a ratio that might please some booze-o-phobic family members, but we wouldn’t make it that way for ourselves. We find it to be a bit too milky, and the brandy painfully absent. Gary Regan likes two ounces of brandy in this drink, which seems like a lot, but might work with a sweeter creme de cacao. We use the dryer Tempus Fugit Cacao, which does well with the ratios listed here. If you only have half and half, don’t sweat it. Cream does make a superior drink however, with a silky texture and hefty character. Milk, whether skim or whole, should be avoided here, as it tends to result in a beverage that tastes like alcoholic chocolate milk."

    "description": "New Orleans bartender Joseph Santini is credited with one of the early attempts to artfully add citrus to spirit and sweetener, occurring sometime in the mid 1800s. The result of this innovation was the Brandy Crusta: possibly the founding member of the sours family of cocktails, which some historians have dubbed the grandfather of the Sidecar. To aptly crown such a remarkable beverage, a distinctive garnish composed of sugared rim and prominent lemon peel is a required companion. When occasion calls for a brandy based classic and presentation is a priority, the crusta is at the top of the list.\nTime has brought many variations on this recipe, allowing for easy tailoring to suit one’s taste. Classic recipes—including the first put to print in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 How to Mix Drinks—contain a substantial dose of brandy with minimal citrus and sweetener. Around the end of the 1800s, the substitution of maraschino liqueur for simple syrup became the fashion. More contemporary interpretations often up the dose of lemon juice, though we find the result all too indistinguishable from other sours, particularly the sidecar. Instead, we prefer the larger dose of brandy found in the classics; it produces a crusta with flavor unique enough to stand out from its descendants.\nThe recipe presented here, which was plucked from Mr. Boston, yields a bouquet full of lemon and bitters, almost floral and perfumey from citrus oil and cognac. The sip is juicy and herbal from the citrus and maraschino, with a very dry backbone from the brandy. Because brandy is the centerpiece, using a good brandy or cognac is a good idea. Creating the signature lemon peel glass liner requires using the shell of half a lemon. The sugared rim can be a bit fussy. To create an evenly crusted coating, two tricks have proven successful. First, line the lip of the glass with lemon juice before dipping in sugar. Second, try to use superfine sugar if possible. Superfine sugar (also caster sugar or baker’s sugar) can be found in most baking aisles, or alternatively, can be made at home by exposing your common granulated sugar to a few pulses in a coffee grinder or food processor."

    "description": "This pre-Prohibition classic is one of four cocktails named for the boroughs of New York City, along with the Bronx, the Manhattan, and the Queens. It first appeared in Jack Grohusko’s 1908 Jack’s Manual with sweet vermouth, which was replaced with French vermouth when reprinted in Jacques Straub’s 1914 Manual of Mixed Drinks. This vermouth choice was adopted by the canonical Savoy Cocktail Book of 1930 and Ted Haigh’s 2004 Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails. Subsequently, it is the mix most often encountered on the modern day bar menu.\nThe Brooklyn’s mix of rye, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and orange-forward amaro result in a Manhattan-style drink that’s a bit sweeter and fruitier than the preeminent classic. Maraschino liqueur adds a rich sweetness, which nicely balances the dry vermouth. In his Bartender’s Manual, Jim Meehan suggests that blanc vermouth may be superior in drinks of this era, asserting that this popular option of the day pairs better with fruity modifiers. We've tried it both ways and do prefer the blanc, though it will depend on the other ingredients.\nThe original Brooklyn cocktail uses a bittersweet French aperitif called Amer Picon. Amer Picon is difficult to acquire in the United States, and even if you smuggle a bottle from France, it has been reformulated. Fortunately there are a few creative substitutions available. Using an orange-heavy Italian amaro such as Ciociaro could work well, or a less-orangey amaro such as amaro Montenegro plus a dash of orange bitters. We prefer to use the similarly French amer Bigallet China-China, which has a comparable bitterness with orange and cherry notes. If you want to try this drink the way it first appeared in Jack’s Manual, use Cocchi Vermouth di Torino. Try an orange twist as a garnish if you are using a less orange-forward mixture."

    "description": "The modern version of the Brown Derby began at the Vendome in Hollywood's sunset strip. Interestingly, most cocktail-centric literature refers to it as the Vendome Club, while other articles about the establishment and its owner, Billy Wilkerson, list it as the Vendome Cafe or simply as the Vendome. Wikipedia, strangely, calls it the Vendome Wine & Spirits Co. One photo of the storefront, taken in 1933, shows the title without any supplementary nouns. The location this photo was taken at (6666 Sunset Blvd) would be the right spot, as it was just a few blocks from one of the four hilariously-shaped and very popular Brown Derby chain restaurants, for which the cocktail was named—either out of appreciation or ridicule.\nThe Brown Derby is a spectacular cocktail for spring and summer. It has a light, yet satisfying body and a fruity, smart flavor that accompanies brunches and evening happy hours with gusto. The drink is very smooth, with a big whiff of bourbon and grapefruit on the nose. The sip is mostly grapefruit at first before finishing with a pleasant sweetness from the syrup and spiciness from the bourbon. It has a sunny, yellow-orange hue and a creamy, opaque tone.\nWhile it is maybe not quite as good as its kissing cousin, the blinker, the Brown Derby succeeds as a utilitarian beverage that requires only the most basic household ingredients to make. Bourbon and grapefruit are an easy combo to find, even in homes without a bar, and the honey syrup can be replaced with regular sugar. Despite its simple recipe, the drink is complex, smooth, and round. Feel free to cut into the sweetener a bit for a dryer drink. As with any bourbon cocktail, don’t choose anything too fancy or complex. We often like Four Roses in our cocktails, though Bulleit would be a nice choice too."

In our defense, this delectable nib-soaked liqueur has been begging for a dusting-off since its heyday at the turn of the century, and who are we to refuse chocolate? That said, don’t let our confectionary tendencies fool you; this cocktail is simple, snappy, and strong. It’s capable of warming the permafrost from Yukon Cornelius’ rosy cheeks, or drowning out the loudest of Aunt Beulah's libertarian soapboxes.\nThis recipe began as a riff on the classic Blood and Sand, with cacao acting as a substitute for Cherry Heering. Unfortunately, it never really came together. As we tinkered with different ratios, the recipe began to resemble another recent addition: the Bobby Burns. Not only did this comparison prove amply helpful in the naming department, it also turned out to be a winning model. The Scotch comes through with gusto, the vermouth applies balance and depth, and the cacao and Angostura ring in the holiday vibes. It’s smoky, strong, and rich with deep notes of chocolate, orange, and clove.\nDon’t waste a good Scotch on this, unless you are receiving free access to grandpa’s favorite single malt after a strong showing at Uno. Otherwise, a blended variety will do fine. We like something with a bit of smoke, like Peat Monster or Monkey Shoulder. While finding a good creme de cacao can still be a bit of a minefield, noteworthy variations are cropping up. Tempus Fugit makes our favorite variety, with mild sweetness and a deep chocolaty flavor. If that isn’t available, Marie Brizard has never killed anyone (though we did once put a bottle of cassis out of its misery) and we’ve heard making your own can yield excellent returns. Whatever path you choose, give this cocktail a shot. After all, who couldn’t use a little Scotch and chocolate by the fire? If Burl were here, we like to think he’d have three."

    "description": "While flipping through the pages of Maggie Hoffman’s book The One-Bottle Cocktail, we were immediately drawn to this simple spin on frothy holiday classics. Hoffman urges fans of eggnog to try this concoction—created by Brandon Presbury of San Francisco’s Lazy Bear—and we second that sentiment. The drink utilizes a handful of pantry staples, including the oft overlooked buttermilk, resulting in an approachable display of balanced decadence. This is an excellent choice for the holidays if egg nog feels old hat, or any moment that requests a respectable alternative to the overstuffed lot of questionable yet popular dessert drinks out there.\nIt’s no surprise that this cocktail is sweet and creamy, but the beauty of this festive spin lies in the use of buttermilk. Compared to cream, which is the more common option, buttermilk provides a lighter body and pleasing tang that balances maple’s sweetness. Immediately present on the nose is the heavenly aroma of buttered rum or rich toffee, with a hint of hazelnut and coffee undertones. The sip is full of rich sweetness from the maple syrup and bourbon, which also lends a complementary nuttiness. Cold brew provides bitterness and depth of flavor, reminiscent of a more sophisticated white russian. As can sometimes be the case with flips, this one doesn’t taste or smell strongly of egg; it can easily be served without drinkers knowing it has the ingredient present. Hazelnut lingers around at the end, perhaps because its texture sticks in your mouth. Pretty little flakes of grated hazelnut bring a lot of visual appeal, complementing the drink’s light neutral tone and appearing like snowflakes gracing the top of an icy peak.\nThis drink could easily support a little heavier pour of bourbon, so feel free to adjust to your level of holiday cheer. With that in mind, stick to your good old reliable mixing bourbon—you don’t want to drown your good stuff in buttermilk. A bourbon with a profile of maple and vanilla is complementary. There are plenty of delicious canned cold brew coffees available these days, so simply reach for your favorite. As with any egg drink: first dry shake to emulsify, then follow with a second shake on ice. If you find yourself without hazelnuts, don’t let that stop you. Grate hazelnut if ya got em, if not make it anyway."

    "description": "The Champagne Cocktail is a timeless showstopper. Champagne itself is an indulgence for many, but there are celebrations that demand gilding the lily. This cocktail is the only bit of opulence fit to accompany the aggressively indulgent dropping of multiple tons of Waterford Crystal over a crowd of Yankee dandies. So ring in the New Year with a drink of equal parts science experiment and sequined dress.\nThe classic Champagne Cocktail is a simple mixture: soak a sugar cube in bitters and top with Champagne. When selecting a bubbly, there are two camps. The drink’s reliance on sparkling wine suggests a top shelf option is best suited to the role, however the purist would not dare pollute the natural delights of authentic Champagne. We favor economy, and suggest a tasty dry prosecco or cava. The drier the better to avoid sugar overload. If feeling particularly fancy, add a splash of quality brandy; the spirit partners with bitters to warm the drink’s crisp sweetness. The classic recipe employs Angostura bitters, but there's plenty of room for creativity. To dress this drink to the nines we recommend Bittermens Burlesque Bitters. The slightly exotic hibiscus blend is ideal for a truly swanky soiree.\nFor optimal drama prepare the sugar cube in a glass and pour in the bubbly at the last minute. The cocktail’s glamour surfaces as the sugar cube dissolves in Champagne. As cute as a vintage coupe may seem, to maximize the effect and retain effervescence make sure to use a Champagne flute."

    "description": "Dousing an old bourbon classic like the mint julep with Champagne may sound odd, but the family has a playful past involving numerous ingredients like rum, rye, and in this case: brandy and bubbly. The Champagne Julep is an elegant merging of the refreshing derby classic with the brilliantly simple Champagne Cocktail. It's a big sparkly glass of Americana.\nThis recipe departs from the familiar bourbon base, instead opting for two ounces of quality brandy. After muddling the mint and simple syrup, pile on the ice and top it off with bubbly dry Champagne. For those that think mixing proper Champagne is a desecration, affordable and tasty Cavas and Proseccos abound. Champagne and brandy make a brilliant couple; the spirit’s nuttiness warms the drink’s crisp sweetness and mint brightens the decadent duo. This is a great opportunity to experiment with bitters, so top it all off with an aromatic dash (or two).\nCrushed ice is ideal for a julep. If you don’t have an ice crusher, you can easily make it by hand: simply place some in a towel and whack it with something hefty, like a rolling pin. For less refined folks such as we, why not brutalize your ice by bashing a bundle against the nearest hard surface, beating out any residual stress from the previous year."

    "description": "The Champs Elysees was first recorded in the Savoy Cocktail Book in 1930. The original recipe was formulated for a party of six, and calls for the somewhat mysterious “sweetened lemon juice” without any assistance on how to make it. Attempts to scale down the recipe have resulted in a handful of interpretations, documented in various cocktail texts. Whatever your preferred formula, the Champs elegantly pairs Cognac and Chartreuse to deliver a double dose of french ingredients ready to delight any good francophile.\nChartreuse is a pale green or yellow liqueur made from brandy and aromatic herbs. The formula allegedly includes 130 herbs, plants, flowers, and secret ingredients, but the exact recipes are known only by the monks responsible for production. The Champs Elysees recipe printed in the Savoy doesn’t specify a type of Chartreuse, but intuition steered us toward the familiar Green Chartreuse. The result was an elegant drink: sweet, citrusy, and herbaceous. Yellow Chartreuse may yield a milder drink with slightly less bite. If you go with yellow, consider reducing the measure of simple syrup just slightly.\nAfter much experimentation, we landed on a set of proportions that really complement the substantial dose of cognac. Our ratio delivers a citrusy, fruity nose, and tastes light on the tongue with an herbal backbone. Feel free to tinker with the dosage of lemon juice and simple syrup to add sweetness or tartness to taste. The Champs Elysees is sure to appeal to fans of chartreuse, but won’t offend those on the fence."

    "description": "What happened to pineapple? Classic cocktail tomes burst with pineapple gums, syrups, juices, sticks, and rounds. New world explorers referred to it as “the nectar of the gods,” and employed it as such in countless punches with their other favorite nectar: rum. Large scale farming in Hawaii made pineapple an exotic staple of the early 20th century, yet today's finer cocktail establishments seem content to ignore it. Sure, it makes an abbreviated appearance in a number of tiki drinks, but always alongside twelve other ingredients. Perhaps it's the long, sad legacy of the piña colada, but the thoughtful Brooklyn barkeep seems more apt to reach for a grapefruit these days.\nWe think that's a shame, because pineapple juice is perfect for cocktails. It's sweet, complex, beautifully colored, and when shaken, creates a thick velvety texture with a nice froth on top. It's affordable, readily available, and downright delicious. Ok, we’ll stop. But seriously, do yourself a favor and give this relatively new cocktail, created by Marcovaldo Dionysus, a shot. It may have Chartreuse in the name, but to us, it's all about pineapple.\nLike any good pineapple drink, start with a shaker. To get a thick, creamy texture, combine the ingredients and shake to all hell with a couple of ice pellets, then pop the top off and pour it unstrained. Variations on this drink abound, with the amount of rum ranging from zero to an ounce. We definitely recommend going easy on the rum, as it can quickly overwhelm the color and flavor, but a splash adds a caramelly depth. Some variations suggest mint as a garnish, but this distracts from the sweet, herbal nose of the Chartreuse. A lime wheel is all this drink really needs, but a pineapple slice wouldn't hurt."

    "description": "Adapted from the Savoy Cocktail book and often subject to dramatic variation, the Chicago cocktail is a Champagne drink that—due to its unusually spirit forward nature—is appropriate for more than one day a year. While at first glance it shares some similarities with the Champagne cocktail, it carries a much larger dose of brandy, which sets it apart from the average light and brunchy sparkling affair. Instead, the result is a rare instance when sparkling feels simply like a component: the center of the drink, as opposed to a great many family members that taste like Champagne with stuff in it. The nose is full of fruity grape and orange, along with strong boozy whiffs from the brandy. Up front the sip delivers a hint of acidity along with the bubbly texture of sparkling wine, followed by a lot of orange liqueur and more fruitiness from the brandy. Overall, the Chicago is enigmatic and benefits from attention to detail; too much sparkling will over dilute and change the character of the drink. After much experimentation, we came upon our preferred ratio, including an increased dose of orange liqueur and defined measure of bubbly.\nSome versions call for sugaring the rim of the glass. To do so, prepare it by rubbing a lemon slice around the rim and dipping it in superfine sugar. It can be served on the rocks in a double old-fashioned glass or straight up in a coupe, flute, or cocktail glass. Make sure to taste this drink before serving it, as the sweetness level of both the sparkling and orange liqueur can dramatically affect the balance of the drink. A dry curacao will probably require extra sweetening, and is likely not the best choice here. A fun alteration is to use China-China Amer in place of orange liqueur if you have it. We found it to be less candy like and, debatably, an improvement. Don’t get too tricky with the sparkling—we’ve found that a complex regional sparkling doesn’t work as well as a simple straightforward classic. This drink is a good opportunity to experiment with bitters, but the profile is on the lighter side and even one extra dash of this or that will change things dramatically."

    "description": "Dressed up vermouth is kind of a rare thing in the states, and in the cocktail world in general. The Chrysanthemum is a fairly unique drink that marries dry vermouth and Benedictine with a splash of absinthe, which yields a simple and sophisticated herbal cup with a light body dominated by fortified wine. With no base liquor, this golden yellow drink is a gentler option than many of its contemporaries, ideally suited to afternoon sipping, as an aperitif, or any time when a low ABV drink is a good look.\nWe decided to revisit the Chrysanthemum after stumbling across it in Cocktail Codex, where we were intrigued to see it categorized as a member of the old fashioned family. Their recipe employs a 5:1 ratio of vermouth to Benedictine— proportions that allow the drink to fit their thesis (“there are only six cocktails”)—but also make for a significant shift from the pre-prohibition one. Hugo R Ensslin first documented the drink in his 1916 Recipes for Mixed Drinks, calling for equal parts dry vermouth and Benedictine. This is definitely a sweeter option; likely too sweet for modern tastes. Fourteen years later the iconic Savoy barbook mentioned a modified ratio of 2:1. This version was popularized at the American Bar on the SS Europa, a German ocean liner that provided escape from prohibition for U.S. tipplers. However much a departure the Cocktail Codex recipe is from past formulas, it is an excellent drink, and our favorite variation.\nThe nose is full of grape from vermouth, a lot of absinthe, a bit of Benedictine and a slight hint of orange. The wine provides a delicate base that kindly carries the heavier, more herbaceous qualities of absinthe and Benedictine, which play very well together and bring complexity in what is otherwise essentially a glass of vermouth. For such a delicate drink the absinthe surprisingly doesn’t overwhelm its bedfellows. A garnish of orange peel adds a lot in terms of presentation even if it isn’t huge on the nose.\nThe Chrysanthemum is an excellent choice any time you want to experiment with an interesting variety of vermouth, though stick to dry as opposed to blanc vermouth, because it is pretty sweet even with the dry vermouth base. We used Absinthia Blanche, which is an absinthe from California, and we were absolutely in love with the results. Absinthia is fairly mellow for an absinthe and avoids the firewater profile of some alternatives. This makes it a good choice for a more delicate cocktail like this one. Give it a short stir: otherwise this delicate, light drink could just become water."

    "description": "Borrowed from the pages of the always awesome Death & Co. cocktail book, Brad Farran’s shaken agave creation lies somewhere between a tiki drink and a Margarita. This is a friendly and approachable tequila drink that anybody will enjoy. The warmth of cinnamon carries this drink out of summer confinement, combining with citrus for a classic wintery orange-spice flavor combo that feels multi-seasonally appropriate. It’s light body and refreshing flavor bring a little bit of much needed sunshine to the winter season.\nThis bright, frosty yellow beverage delivers a balanced mixture of tart and sweet, with a strong tequila backbone and funky punch from full bodied rum and cinnamon spice. The sip is full of citrus and tequila, followed by a lingering warmth of spice and spirits and a hint of caramel notes from the gold rum that brings it all together. The use of muddled orange lends a thick, fibrous texture that extends each flavor throughout the palate. It’s muddled fruit, boozey vibes, and the surprising addition of warm cinnamon remind us of the also excellent Sutter's Mill.\nThe Cinnamon Girl is fairly forgiving, so don’t sweat the small stuff. The original recipe calls for Smith and Cross rum, but Hamilton would be a particularly delicious substitute. An affordable reposado tequila, such as Cimarron blends nicely with the cinnamon. It’s quite simple to make your own cinnamon syrup; Death & Co. even provides a recipe in their appendix, however, when we’re feeling less ambitious we use the balanced BG Reynolds Cinnamon Cocktail Syrup. The cinnamon flavor is so tasty that you could go all in and replace simple syrup. This concoction could certainly handle a larger dose of orange bitters to amp up depth of flavor, if it were to suit one’s tastes."

    "description": "We first came across the Claridge Cocktail in Barflies and Cocktails. The book attributes the drink’s creation to “Leon, bartender, Claridge’s Hotel, Champs Elysees, Paris”. Employing two liqueurs to fancy up a base of gin and vermouth, this drink could be considered a fruity spin on a martini. But don’t expect something dry; this much liqueur yields a rather sweet drink. Apricot is a surprisingly versatile flavor, somehow both wintery and summery at the same time. Possessing a richness that feels nocturnal, this drink is perfect for evenings when you want spirit forward, but simultaneously crave fruity.\nApricot and vermouth form a surprisingly delicious partnership, with apricot brandy providing an uncommen leading role and a great opportunity to try a new bottle. The nose is all grape and fruit, with a finish full of apricot and orange, while gin provides body. The result is floral, gloriously perfumed, and fruity in a bonk you over the head type way. It's a particularly feminine sort of spirit-forward drink—delicate, yet potent—with an eye catching rose gold hue.\nThe original Claridge recipe calls specifically for apricot brandy, which inspires speculation as to what ingredient would have actually been used. There are basically two options available: a sweet apricot liqueur, which may or may not have a brandy base, or an apricot eau de vie, a clear fruit brandy. General consensus seems to lean towards liqueur. If you opt for the eau de vie, you’ll have to tinker with proportions, as it’s rather dry. Regardless, you really can’t go wrong with either. In terms of liqueurs, Rothman and Winter apricot is our go to. For a snappier finish, try a dash of orange bitters. We recommend resisting the temptation to add a garnish, as it detracts from the delicate smell of apricot. The recipe requests a shake, but we prefer to stir."

    "description": "The Clover Club, invented at the raucous turn-of-the-century dinner establishment of the same name, was all the rage in the teens before quickly falling out of favor. Such a decline in popularity isn't really surprising. The cocktail is kind of a pain to make, and suffered greatly from ill-advised substitution.Grenadine was commonly used as a fill-in for the more exotic raspberry syrup, but these two ingredients are nothing alike. As egg fell out of fashion, the recipe lost another integral component, and the cocktail quickly became unworthy of the drinker's glass.\nWhen made properly, however, the Clover Club is an exceptional drink. It's one of those special recipes where fresh ingredients combine with bottled spirits to form something wholly unique in color, texture, and flavor. The mixture that pours from the shaker is greater than the sum of what went in. Even before the first whiff, the drink is beautiful to look at. It pours out chalky and pink before gracefully settling into a regal magenta, which contrasts beautifully with the white froth. The juniper and lemon balance nicely with the raspberry, and the egg creates a frothy, indulgent texture.\nWith a bit of time, preparation, and a few fresh ingredients, an exceptional Clover Club can be prepared with only basic bar items. While several premade raspberry syrups exist, we highly recommend making it yourself. It's cheap, better tasting, and simple to make: start with a normal 1:1 simple syrup, then add a cup of fresh berries to the pot. Once the berries have broken down, strain and bottle it. If you are shy about drinking egg, most grocery stores carry pasteurized egg white. Dry shaking isn’t necessary, just give the drink a good long workout over ice pellets, until most of the ice has dissolved. The more delicate, floral notes of this drink can be overpowered by a strong batch of lemon; if your lemons are particularly zesty, use a scant measure. If you don’t have dry vermouth, don’t worry: an extra quarter-ounce of syrup should do the trick. Serve up with a fresh raspberry for garnish."

    "description": "The Cock N’ Bull was a popular pub on Hollywood’s sunset strip, operated by bartender and famed anglophile Jack Morgan. Instead of the usual celebrity photos, the walls featured a few paintings of Queen Victoria, some other dead royalty, plus a dartboard. It was popular with famous actors, authors, and for a while, Rod Stewart’s soccer team. The bar is legendary not for its famous clientele however, but for the vodka drinks it helped popularize. This is particularly true for their most famous drink: the Moscow Mule. And while the Cock N’ Bull—created in and named after our storied pub—may never reach the same heights, it recoups whatever celebrity it might be lacking through a boozy, delectable charisma.\nThe Cock N’ Bull is dark, spicy, seductive, and a little sweet. It employs a no-frills, lowball utilitarianism reminiscent of workhorses like the old fashioned and Negroni. It also shares quite a few characteristics with the Vieux Carré. Like that cocktail, it has the admirable qualities of pre-citrus cocktails, but with a level of sophistication and complexity above and beyond the fold. It is the perfect recipe for a night when citrus sounds like overkill, and the soft clink of ice against the rim of a glass simply cannot be gone without.\nThis cocktail is naturally pretty sweet. If you aren’t in the mood, try dropping a quarter ounce of Benedictine, or even a bit of the Curacao. In situations like this, we prefer Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao, which will not only ratchet up the complexity, but also help balance the sweetness. Some versions of this drink call for bitters, while others do not. We think these sorts of beverages can only benefit from the zesty stuff, and accordingly recommend a dash or two. This drink can be made by pouring the ingredients directly into the glass, but we always prefer the look of a drink prepared in a mixing glass. That said, if your day sucked, don’t let us keep you from one-dish zen."

    "description": "Sometimes called De La Louisiane, but generally referred to by its longer and harder to type name, the Cocktail à la Louisiane is a lesser known member of the classic New Orleans family of drinks. It comfortably occupies a seat between two esteemed cousins: the Vieux Carré and the sazerac, and has a wonderful personality that speaks volumes to the versatility and depth of the region’s style.\nThe recipe requests equal parts rye, Benedictine, and sweet vermouth. Because it is equal parts without citrus, it has the perk of being boozy but not spirit-forward. This also means it can be rather sweet, so know your audience; but the absinthe and Peychaud's Bitters round the drink out for a finished product that most people will find wonderfully balanced.\nAs with any drink that lacks citrus, forgo the shaker and reach for a mixing glass. Like the Vieux Carré, this drink can be over-stirred, so relax with the twisty spoon; a few seconds of rapid whirring should do just fine, with the length varying slightly based on the size of ice. Some versions of this recipe call for three cherries, which is a lot of cherries. We opt for two, a quantity that feels indulgent without looking like a fruit salad. Serve the drink in a coupe or cocktail glass, and enjoy."

    "description": "We stumbled across this adorable sounding drink while flipping through the pages of Easy Tiki. Ezra Star of the Boston based bar Drink, resourcefully paired heavy cream with orgeat, pineapple juice, and aged Demerara rum to create a go-to drink for moments when they were short on one of tiki’s favorite ingredients: coconut cream. The result is a real crowd pleaser full of wintery tiki vibes. It's full-bodied yet refreshing—kind of like an upgraded pina colada, tropical nog, or rummy milk punch. It’s fun, it’s different, yet it’s friendly enough that it won’t scare off less adventurous drinkers: an excellent choice for when you are chillin' with your mom and she wants a cocktail, but you can’t bear to make just another Brandy Alexander.\nThe nose provides a blast of cinnamon, nutmeg and pineapple. Up front you get a big hit of creamy chocolatey-ness, followed by more fruity pineapple and rummy flavors and a lingering funky pineapple at the end. The texture is nice and creamy. As the source implies, this drink’s preparation is very simple: four ingredients with easy to remember ratios. Demerara rum is really important in this drink because it gives it the chocolatey, caramelly finish that contributes to the confectionery, wintery vibes. These days there are a million small makers producing orgeat; we typically like Small Hand Foods but recently have been opting for Liber & Co simply because we can get a smaller portion of it (9.5oz vs 17.5oz, as a home bar we can rarely get through a full bottle). The drink is fairly sweet so you could consider knocking back on the sweeteners if that isn’t your thing. Shake it for a few seconds—not too long—you don’t want to dilute it much since it’s being poured over crushed ice. To give it a nice bit of complexity we add a bit of funky rum as a float. While the original recipe calls for a tonka bean for unique garnish, these are pretty hard to come by, we opted for a classic dusting of spices."

    "description": "As far as decadent and creamy cocktails go, this impossible-to-google unit might be the merriest thing this side of a Baltimore Eggnog. As an added bonus, the drink is nearly as old as they come: it was added to the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas’s groundbreaking Bartender’s Manual. Though the book doesn’t say much about the recipe, it does note that the bizarre name likely came from the finished product’s appearance and not the use of coffee. While its bland epithet isn’t exactly cafe friendly, don’t let that discourage you; this is one of the all-time great winter drinks, and will offer an excellent and educational substitute for aunties and uncles who would just die for a Kahlua and vodka.\nLike all good cocktails, the coffee is greater than the sum of its parts. The scent is fruity and caramelly, with spicy elements from the nutmeg. The sip is earthy, silky, and—despite having zero cacao-based ingredients—chocolatey. It has a malty quality reminiscent of drinks like the Ramos Gin Fizz and bourbon milk punch (unsurprisingly, this drink is rumored to be from New Orleans). It also shares an unrelenting yuletide fervor comparable with the excellent and equally ancient rum flip.\nThis recipe is very good in its original form, and therefore does not need many alterations. Make sure to reach for a decent port; we use the Quinta Do Infantado tawny port with excellent results. While pre-ground nutmeg is always better than zero nutmeg, we especially like the freshly grated stuff. Egg freaks some people out. Don’t let that stop you from making this drink. Though they never smell quite as good, pasteurized eggs from the box will work fine. The feathery smell will not make it past the nutmeg anyways."

    "description": "The town of Coldfoot lies halfway between Fairbanks and Deadhorse, on a dangerous road that provides supplies to remote oil communities stretched along the arctic coast of Alaska. The town—previously a mining establishment—was reinvigorated by Dick Mackey, a former Iditarod champion who opened up a burger stand in an old school bus. Today, Coldfoot boasts a restaurant, a post office, and even a small airstrip. If that weren’t enough, it now somewhat unofficially boasts its own cocktail, thanks to yours truly. We chose the name as a reference to the recipe's closest sibling: the Alaska, but it also feels right at home with the utterly icy package of ingredients we conjured up.\nThe Coldfoot began as an excuse to tinker with creme de menthe, a criminally underutilized ingredient that likely gets the shaft for its difficult flavor profile and overwhelming strength. For inspiration, we looked to the hanky panky, another drink that walks the line, but instead with the famously difficult fernet branca. The hanky panky succeeds by dropping the difficult ingredient's dosage substantially—all the way down to a dash—and effectively employing it as a bitter. Similarly, we reduced the dosage of creme de menthe substantially and the results are lovely. All four ingredients come through on the nose for a transfixing whiff of juniper, maraschino, fresh mint, and chartreuse. The sip is sweet at first from the green chartreuse and maraschino liqueur, but follows quickly with balancing heat from the strong ingredients and gin base. As an added bonus, the red cherry and green body make for a downright festive holiday appearance.\nMint is an amazingly complex herb, something anyone who has eaten a good tagine can attest to. Luckily for us, exquisite labels like Tempus Fugit and Giffard Menthe Pastille are making the complex flavors of mint more readily available. These versions go beyond the one-dimensional flavors of old school schnapps and offer many of the complex layers found in the fresh stuff. As for the gin: it might be tempting to reach for something complex, but with all these other flavors flying around, we find simple is best. We make ours with BarMatt’s gin to excellent results. We tend to prefer a milder maraschino such as Maraska, and that’s what we use here. Luxardo might be good too, especially since the drink is pretty bold, but we haven’t tried it yet. This recipe calls for a teaspoon of creme de menthe, but if you are feeling spunky, a quarter ounce isn’t bad either."

    "description": "Holiday drinks tend to be creamy, sweet, and indulgent. The conifer is none of those things. It is boozy, piney, and brazenly herbaceous, which makes it perfect for holiday guests who prefer their cocktails spirit forward. It might also be the perfect gift for yourself after making that seventh round of eggnog for the aunts and uncles. The recipe calls for a bit of an esoteric ingredient list, with both pear brandy and spruce essence in the mix, but we’ve outlined several good substitutes further down.\nThe drink begins with a brisk whiff of spruce, pear, herbs, and cherry. Sense-awakening hints of alcohol are there too, emanating from the formidable combo of clear spirits in this recipe. The sip is mellow at first, then hits the back of the tongue with a big splash of spruce and Chartreuse which lingers for a surprisingly long time. It has a bright, martini-like clarity with just a hint of green from the Chartreuse, which plays beautifully off the red from the cherry.\nSpruce essence is traditionally used to make spruce beer. It can be found at brewing shops, or ordered online. It is incredibly strong, and can easily turn a drink into pine-slop without care. We use an eyedropper to measure out six individual droplets. If you can’t track down spruce essence at all, or are making this in a pinch, don’t sweat it. It really only acts as a bitter, accessorizing a recipe that is already mostly there. We’ve had several great pear brandies: St. George and Clear Creek both make awesome American varieties, and we’ve recently been turned on to F. Meyer’s version as well. If you don’t have pear brandy, a dry apple brandy might work too."

    "description": "Often, those who love spirits love simple cocktails because they can tinker with them. A short recipe means fewer distractions and subsequently more breathing room for the complex ingredients they love. The whiskey and gin families are full of drinks like these, but rum is a bit different. The members in this family are big and complicated, with recipes that look less like mixing instructions and more like fighter jet manuals. Fortunately, a handful of simple classics exist, allowing rum fans the freedom to enjoy their beloved spirit along with its many mixing companions.\nIn the ranks of great rum companions, falernum is surely near the top. Many internet words have been spilled over this syrup and its foggy history, including a fable about how to say “you have to learn it” in a heavy Barbadian accent. The mixture itself infuses clove, lime, and almond into a base of sugar, water and rum. It has a low alcohol content and probably originated as a bottled form of a popular local punch. Most importantly: it’s inexpensive, generally well stocked, and fun and easy to make. We recommend making it, but the store bought stuff is good too. Hell, try both. Comparing them is fun and a bottle goes fast.\nThe Corn n' Oil is a simple drink that uses a lot of falernum, and the flavor profile follows suit. Each swig is chock full of clove, lime, vanilla, molasses and almond. It's a convincing rebuttal to those who think rum is only for summer. The classic recipe calls for blackstrap rum, but any dark and complex variety will do. We love to tinker, and seem to try a different variety every time, with few regrets. In fact, the only way to go wrong with this drink is to avoid it altogether."

    "description": "It's a surprise and a shame that this cocktail has not become a standard of the brunch menu, taking a seat next to the Bloody Mary and Mimosa. Presumably its omission has something to do with the stigma of absinthe, but the Corpse Reviver #2 is arguably the best hair of the dog. This gin-based recipe is the superior variation in a family of largely obsolete cocktails. In fact, drop the formality of the “number 2” and there’s no confusion about which formula you’re referring to.\nComposed of equal parts gin, cointreau, lemon, and Lillet, it makes for easy AM assembly. The intensely aromatic absinthe followed by a bright, tart jolt of flavor will definitely clear the morning haze. We strongly suggest coating the glass with absinthe to keep its contribution relatively subtle. Lillet and Cocchi Americano are fairly interchangeable here, Cocchi being slightly sweeter.\nAs transcribed in The Savoy Cocktail Book, the Corpse Reviver, along with many other cocktails, calls for the ingredient Kina Lillet. Unfortunately, the producers of Kina Lillet changed the formula in the 1980s, sending it into the abyss alongside countless vintage cocktail ingredients. The reformulation resulted in Lillet Blanc, but many claim Cocchi Americano is now closer to the original. Try both and see what suits your tastes; your hangover will thank you."

    "description": "What is in a name? A “creole” cocktail can be found in print as early as 1913’s Straub’s Mixed Drinks, but Straub has no notes on the drink, nor does he claim responsibility for it. Avoiding direct association might have been a wise move, as the recipe’s head scratching combination of one part absinthe to two parts dry vermouth does not need to be tried to know it will be gross. This recipe would probably be another leaf floating in the river of bad cocktails published during that era, but it also happens to share epithets with an excellent cocktail immortalized in 1930’s famous Savoy Cocktail Book. Made and riffed upon by bartenders around the world, this creole employs a Manhattan-like composition with a secret weapon: Amer Picon. So do the two drinks have a connection? It’s hard to say, but a little reasoning should promote skepticism. The recipes share zero ingredients and were submitted for print on different continents. It seems more likely that two homesick southerners had the same idea around the same time, but hey—stranger things have happened.\nFor a while, Amer Picon was difficult to find in the states, which made this drink somewhat inaccessible. Ted Haigh published a bizarre version of this cocktail—called the Barbara West—with sherry and no benedictine in his infamous Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, no doubt a reaction to the lack of options at the time. Today, several alternatives are available, many of which we've tried, and while these bitter orange liqueurs are delicious, they are not essential. The scarcity of the label likely overhyped it’s reputation, as it is really just an orange liqueur with a slightly bitter profile. China China Amer can act as a standout substitute, but you can also achieve a rough approximation with either a brandy-based orange liqueur plus a dash of bitters or even something like Aperol or Ciociaro amaro.\nThe original Savoy recipe requests only two dashes of both Amer and Benedictine, yielding a fabulous drink. That said, if you are looking for something that stands out from a traditional Manhattan, there are newer recipes that opt for less vermouth and more of the modifiers. This alteration also yields an excellent cocktail and is definitely worth a try. We like a recipe that calls for a half-ounce of each modifier and reduces the vermouth to a single ounce. The Creole certainly feels southern, with a boozy backbone and injudiciously sweet body. We tried knocking back the sweetness a bit and the drink fell flat: a timely reminder that taste and balance are not codependent. If you are going to attempt a picon substitute, consider using the original recipe, as it calls for less of it."

    "description": "The crop top is a delightful grapefruit-centric cocktail that goes big on sunshine and summery vibes. We discovered it a while back in the book Cocktail Codex, but never got around to covering it during the proper season. It’s very much a drink for a certain set of months, and with an early heat wave setting in, there is no better time than now. When trying the drink, our first impression was “dang that’s grapefruity,” so you’ll need to be in the mood for the big bitter citrus; but if you are, it doesn’t get much better than this. The flavor profile even emulates a grapefruit, with a grassy bitterness that is tempered by an immediate sweetness. The result is bitter but balanced; it’s light, sunny, and mellow. Mix this up on a warm breezy day when a Negroni sounds like a bit too much.\nThe key to this drink, and the thing that initially caught our eye, is the combination of herbal amaro montenegro and pamplemousse. The herbs from the gin and amaro come through strong on the nose. The sip is briefly sour from the lemon before transitioning to a nice grapefruity sweetness that is mellow and very pleasing. This recipe might seem disjointed at first, but it is likely a riff on a modern classic: the paper plane, substituting montenegro for amaro nonino and pamplemousse for aperol.\nThe crop top is a funny and somewhat precarious drink. Because of this, there aren’t a lot of obvious substitutes that would balance well. That said, because the recipe is based on a paper plane, you could try swapping some of those elements: aperol could go in for the pamplemousse, or amaro nonino for the montenegro. Of course if you do both of these you just have a paper plane, which is undoubtedly a fine result but also not really the exercise. As far as bottle selection goes—we’re fans of Giffard pamplemousse and a dry, martini-style gin in this drink."

    "description": "The Cynar flip was first published in Jefferey Morgenthaler’s The Bar Book, an excellent publication from 2014 that also sports a title which is very hard to work into a sentence non-awkwardly. Morgenthaler credits the drink to Ben Sandrof, who arrived at the idea while working on “a sort of ice cream with fernet-branca.” While The Bar Book, has become a standout in the latest class of contemporary cocktail books, the Cynar flip hasn’t enjoyed nearly as much publicity. This is a shame, as this simple recipe belongs amongst the other winter greats, and should have a special appeal to those who love complex and bitter cocktails. Indeed, this may be one of the best ways to experience Cynar; the creaminess from the egg complements the amaro’s bitter complexity perfectly, and creates an unforgettable combination of vegetal complexity and milkshake-like consistency. Often, Cynar is paired with other strong flavors to balance intensity with more intensity, but the Cynar flip walks in the opposite direction, opening up the complexity of one ingredient in minimalist fashion, all to amazing results.\nThe Cynar flip is perfect for the amari lover, and it doesn’t need to be limited to Cynar. We dreamt up several bitter replacements—from fernet and Zucca to amaro Ciociaro or Campari—that could make for an amazing variation, and we’re excited to riff on this formula each holiday season. The recipe does not easily form a frothy head worthy of a discerning eye, so those who are pickier will want to dry shake for a full twenty seconds before shaking again for another full twenty seconds over ice. This drink is best when thick and icy, so the extra shaking will be worth it. It also helps to choose appropriate glassware; varieties with moderate proportions and slightly narrower mouths will fare better than traditional wide-mouthed cocktail glasses. If you don’t have the glassware, don’t let it stop you. From amazing holiday staples like the rum flip to the coffee cocktail, the flip family is an excellent and underrated category of drinks, and this one might be among the strongest additions we’ve tried."

    "description": "Contrary to popular belief, a daiquiri does not involve berries, bananas, or frozen bits of any kind. When freed from the shackles of dive bar Slurpee machines, a true minimalist is revealed. A rum based sour, the daiquiri is fundamental, founding a family of cocktails defined by rum, citrus, and sweetener. Its simplicity allows for easy adaptation and respectable variations exist, most notably the Hemingway daiquiri. Unfortunately, left in the wrong hands, adaptability led to adulteration and the daiquiri became synonymous with a premixed distortion of itself.\nThe classic daiquiri requires only three ingredients: rum, lime juice, and simple syrup. This drink is at its best, crisp, bright, and pool appropriate, especially when light rum is involved. Plantation 3 Stars, with a subtly sweet and tropical profile, is ideal for mixing. If feeling experimental, a dark rum will result in a richer, smoother concoction, though it requires some fiddling with ratios. When properly balanced, the sweet and sour step back, and the daiquiri becomes an ideal way for a rum lover to enjoy good rum.\nIf you want to keep it interesting, try an alternative to shaking. Once upon a time the drink was built in a tall glass over cracked ice. Start by pouring the sugar over the ice, add the lime juice, and top with rum. Slide in a straw and give it a little stir. No matter how it’s prepared—shake it, stir it, layer it—just drink it!"

    "description": "Unlike more infamous drinks sporting his name, Ernest Hemingwayactually might have created this drink. The absinthe and Champagne concoction shares its name with his 1932 fictional bullfighting tale Death in the Afternoon, and was published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon, a 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. Hemingway’s recipe is the first entry in this rather colorful cocktail book and is accompanied by an anecdote surrounding the recipe's development and some simple instructions: \"Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.\" Initially this recipe seemed like a drink that had survived on history and kitsch alone, but trying it for the first time, we were pleasantly surprised. And while we all should be wary of the author’s dosing recommendations, the fact that this recipe is as easy as a jack and coke, but 10 times (at least) classier, makes for a pretty big sell.\nDecadent and strong, Death in the Afternoon hinges on an unlikely yet complementary pair. It hits the nose with absinthe and some underlying notes of grape, but anise dominates. First on the sip is more of the absinthe, and a strong finish of Champagne. The absinthe will louche (or develop a beautiful milky opaqueness) as the flute fills up with champagne. Break this one our for celebrations, as its show stopping bubbles and opalescence are ideal for events that call for something fun, powerful, and dead easy.\nWhether you like this drink or not will depend heavily on if you like the particular brand of absinthe involved. There are many types of absinthe out there, so sample one by itself before trying it in this beverage. Our current go-to is Absinthia, which is relatively mild and ideal for mixing; it allows for a substantial measure that doesn’t overpower the sparkling. The amount of absinthe can and should be modified based on the style you’re using, The original recipe calls for 1 jigger—or a whopping one-and-a-half ounces—of absinthe. For most, this will be too much. Absinthe has a particular flavor profile, some may prefer more, some may prefer less. Many contemporary versions opt for a lighter pour, some reducing the measure to as little as a quarter or half ounce. We’re inclined to agree with the reduced measure and tend to land somewhere in the middle at around 1 oz. A good, dry (brut) sparkling wine or Champagne works well here. Unless your goal is decadence, we wouldn’t recommend spending too much. As for preparation tips, we think Hemingway’s directives are clear enough, so pour booze in cup and squeal with delight."

    "description": "As a recent addition to the cocktail canon, this drink comes complete with a clearly documented explanation for its bizarre name. Within the pages of Regarding Cocktails, creator Zachary Gelnaw-Rubin explains that Debbie, Don’t references the ghost that haunts the bathroom at New York’s Dutch Kills. Don't be too afraid however; as its list of rich ingredients implies, this drink packs a lot of flavor, yet is surprisingly balanced—a definite crowd pleaser. The nose opens with a strong twin punch of sour lemon and bitter herbs. On the palate amaro combined with lemon explodes on the tongue, finishing with a balancing hint of caramelly maple. Somehow the tequila just slips in there, seamlessly mingling with its bedfellows.\nThe blend’s intriguing array of flavors make for a great tasting experience, but it is also a potential palette killer, best suited for the end of a night. Similarly to a paper plane, this formula employs an even measure of base spirit and amaro, its character is therefore fairly dependent upon the choice of amaro. As printed, the recipe recommends Averna, however we also enjoyed the super smooth outcome when using Montenegro. Casamigos’ reposado tequila lends smooth complementary hints of vanilla, perfect for an indulgent blend. Make sure to use a rich, quality, real maple syrup, but measure with caution, as it can quickly overpower its partners. Unfortunately, the drink’s appearance falls short of its impressive flavor. To brighten up its slightly drab tone, try adding a simple garnish such as a lemon peel or even a cherry. Feel free to get creative."

    "description": "Created at the Lord Baltimore Hotel, the diamondback is not named after the snake, but instead the cute little turtles—also known as terrapins—that frequent Maryland’s waters and inspired one of college athletics' least intimidating mascots. Most writers cite Ted Sauciers 1952 book Bottoms Up as the first place the cocktail was published, though we haven’t been able to track down the year it hit the hotel bar menu. The diamondback is fairly well written about, and most pieces mention how strong the drink is. This is true, though the name might bias things a bit: it isn’t much stronger than similar classics like the widows kiss, Alaska, and Monte Carlo. More importantly, the diamondback is a stellar spirit-forward classic: perfect for moments when something timeless yet unexpected is appropriate. The drink is boozy and nocturnal, with a subtle air of luxury. It has a honey-sweet quality from the Yellow Chartreuse and a spiciness from the rye with hints of fruity apple poking through. It finishes with a bit of heat, and the Chartreuse lingers for a while afterwards. The drink is amazingly balanced given how much Chartreuse is used, and every ingredient plays an important role.\nIt is common for bartenders to beef up the diamondback in several ways. A high-proof rye is often employed: a move we can emphatically endorse. We love high-proof Rittenhouse in all sorts of cocktails, and this one is no exception. Some like Green Chartreuse in this drink, which also makes some sense: it stands up better to rye, and also helps differentiate the drink from the very similar and more famous widow’s kiss. Green Chartreuse is almost always a good look, but here the apple notes begin to disappear under all that complexity. Because of this, we stick to the yellow variety. If you are feeling particularly wily, close both eyes and swap in a blended scotch. We can’t officially endorse such reckless behavior, but suffice to say: it has entered our glass once only by accident, but will probably return. While the original recipe does not request a garnish, good brandied cherries are always welcome in recipes like this; the subtle cherry scents won’t interfere with the bold nose, and every drink looks better with a little something on top."

    "description": "Along with drinks like the Doctor Cocktail, this oddly named drink is one of a few classic cocktails most associated with the long lost spiced Nordic liqueur, Swedish Punsch. Credited with the creation of this combination of apple brandy, Swedish punsch, and grapefruit juice; bartender Robert Vermiere included the Diki-Diki in his 1922 book Cocktails: How to Mix Them, mentioning that he introduced the cocktail at London’s Embassy Club that same year. Just one year later, Harry McElhone included a stiffer version of this drink (4:1:1 as opposed to 2:1:1) in his ABC of Mixing Cocktails, noting its great popularity in London. While it predates the movement, its name seems right at home in the world of tiki where it was embraced by Trader Vic and is now often served alongside other oddly named drinks with questionable etymology and origin stories. It could be considered what one might call proto-tiki.\nWe borrowed this recipe from Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, which is a slight modification of Vermiere’s original ratio. This drink really delivers the essence of apple, it smells like apples and it tastes like apples. There are some funky ingredients blended here alongside the fleshy apple brandy, but they all seem to find a way to support the apple. The nose delivers hints of vanilla and sugarcane from the rummy Swedish punsch. On the tongue it’s fleshy and apply, with a finish of heat from the strong booze. Sweetness and spice from the punsch and acidity from grapefruit punch up the apple flavor, resulting in an impressively balanced drink that’s reminiscent of a more complex Jack Rose.\nKronan Swedish Punsch seems to be the only product available in the US right now. You can make it yourself if you feel inspired: David Wondrich provides a recipe in his Punch. While many recipes call specifically for Calvados, you don’t have to use Calvados, there are many other apple brandies. If you do, we have had great success with Domaine de Manoir Du Montreuil Calvados Du Pays D'auge Reserve. The first time we tried this, we made it with AppleJack instead of calvados and it was awesome. Applejack does have the tendency to take over a drink more than calvados does with an intense pure apple flavor. It ultimately will come down to what you want out of the drink, but definitely don’t shy away from it."

    "description": "The doctor cocktail first came to our attention courtesy of the classic Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, of which it is one of several great recipes that include Swedish Punsch.Contrary to the easy assumption, the name doctor does not come from the book’s author, Ted “Dr. Cocktail” Haigh. Like most of the recipes in his book, this one is a revived antique: a recipe that combines Swedish Punsch and lime under the name doctor is traceable back to 1917 in Hugo Esslin’s Recipes for Mixed Drinks. Like many drinks from this time, the doctor had variations which are sprinkled throughout different books of the era and are sometimes differentiated with numbers: doctor No.1, doctor No.2, et al. Haigh bothers with no such formalities, and instead recommends his favorite variation: a 2:1:1 combination of rum, punsch, and lime.\nThe doctor cocktail has a particular demographic: lovers of funk. This strange scent—hogo as it is sometimes called—is common in both Jamaican rum and Swedish Punsch. The latter acquires it’s funk from a base of Batavia Arrack, which is made from Indonesian red rice and has a notably intense flavor profile. This combination of funky flavors makes for a short, strong entry into the proto-tiki family that can cozy up with many different seasons and moods. Like other drinks of this ilk, such as the palmetto and el presidente, the doctor is versatile, easy to make, and endlessly drinkable. Give it a shot when you are feeling something short and funky, or when you are inclined to experiment with Swedish Punsch.\nIf you want to explore something more balanced, consider opting for a lighter rum with a moderately funky profile, such as Plantation 3-star light or Foursquare Probitas. If you are ready to opt-in fully to the funk, then reach for something like Hamilton pot still or Smith and Cross. For Swedish Punsch, the most common choice is Kronan, and it is also the easiest to find. While there are undoubtedly other varieties to experiment with, we’ve yet to try anything else in this cocktail."

    "description": "One of the great things about tequila cocktails, aside from their profuse deliciousness, is the considerable amount of undeveloped real estate. Many of the classic styles and textures—traditionally backed by whiskey, gin, and brandy—are fresh to many a tastebud with tequila. This holds true for egg white cocktails such as fizzes, flips, and nogs, which have been around for a hundred years, but typically get paired with the more traditional stuff.\nHere, the object of our desire is the fizz—tall, bubbly, and creamy—the format is perfect for a sensuous combination of classic fixings and tequila’s boozy blast. The key to this drink is pastis, which sings with the mezcal and helps the cocktail transcend its margarita roots. As the pastis mixes with water, it takes on a creamy color that looks great with egg white. Orgeat plays a good second fiddle: it’s foggy and thick, with a hint of rose reminiscent of the orange blossom water in a Ramos Gin Fizz.\nIf you don’t have orgeat, don’t worry: simple syrup works in a pinch. If you are a bit hesitant to drink raw eggs (don’t worry, we are too) pasteurized egg whites work great and cut out the hassle. Though we’ve always been fond of bludgeoning our ice over the counter until it submits, you might also consider a more pacifistic route: the hand-cranked ice crusher. These things cost around fifteen dollars and can last a decade. Best of all, the work is quick and the resulting texture is consistent and well-proportioned. As with all egg drinks, give this one a good workout in the shaker. If you are feeling cantankerous, pop the top off and spoon the remaining froth onto the top of the drink. Garnish with a lime twist and enjoy over a big heaping bowl of relaxation."

    "description": "The East India first hit printed pages in 1882, published in the New and Improved version of Harry Johnson’s famous bartenders manual. It’s a beautiful drink, eternalized during a period of rapid change in bartending. Like other pre-prohibition drinks in the improved style, the East India gently spiffs up a base spirit with dashes of various fixings. More fashionably, the drink is served up, a style that was rocketing to popularity through vermouth-based drinks like the Manhattan and Martini. Johnson updated the recipe in his 1900 edition, adding a peripheral sentence: “a great favorite with the English living in the different parts of East India.” He also made several alterations, replacing raspberry syrup with pineapple syrup and swapping Boker's bitters for Angostura. The original recipe requests only a lemon twist; in the second he gets creative, suggesting a “cherry or medium sized olive”.\nThe East India is an excellent and offbeat alternative to other very old cocktails. Pineapple syrup, brandy, and curacao work together for a round and fruity taste that rolls over the tongue. It’s a subtle yet intoxicating switch from the spicy and medicinal flavors seemingly inherent to drinks of the time. Some debate exists over which sweetener to use, as Johnson changed the recipe between 1882 and 1890. We think Johnson switched to pineapple syrup for good reason; the stuff has a fruity and complex aroma that brings an element of surprise and delight. Pineapple syrup isn’t hard to make, and we’ve included a recipe for it here. If raspberry syrup is on hand, that will work too. If you own a decent brandy, this is certainly the time to use it; in the words of Paul Clarke: “you’re basically getting dressed-up liquor here.” The 1900 version of this recipe suggests an olive garnish, but that is a gross idea. Always use a lemon twist, indulging in a cherry when the day prescribes it."

    "description": "Created at Please Don’t Tell—a speakeasy in New York—el burro is cleverly named after the recipe it riffs on: the Moscow Mule. As their recipe book explains, el burro means donkey in Spanish, a reference to both the pack animal as well as the below-the-border palette it employs. Soda-pop cocktails are a dangerous art: the intense sweetness and bold flavors can easily overpower everything included. This is a boon at smelly rock n’ roll clubs, where mediocre whiskeys and vodkas need a cheap and simple companion, but in the world of jiggers and barspoons, the role of soda-pop is a precarious one. An overzealous top-off might completely disrupt the whole drink, reducing a smart combination of expensive ingredients into a humble “whiskey coke”. Smartly, el burro requests a small portion of ginger beer, and combines it with equally boisterous flavors, resulting in a satisfying, complex, and wonderfully refreshing highball.\nGinger beer is a world unto itself, with countless options decorating grocery store shelves. Goslings is excellent and widely distributed. We’ve had good luck with Fever Tree too. That said, when Reed’s is available, we don’t think twice. This recipe requests that the beer be shaken with the drink, which seems strange at first, but probably helps dilute and disperse the powerful ginger flavor. The original recipe requests reposado tequila specifically, though we imagine it working just fine with blanco tequila. We’ve seen several different garnishes on this drink: candied ginger, lime peels, and jalapeno wheels. Of the three, we like jalepeno best. The spiciness adds an element of surprise, and the vegetable notes create an extra layer of complexity. We like this drink over crushed ice, but it would be good over cubed ice too. If you want crushed ice, just give a handful of cubes several whacks over the counter in a plastic bag. Serve this drink in a tall glass or—for maximum summer excitement—a small mason jar."

    "description": "Tequila’s slice of cocktail history is small, especially juxtaposed to more pedigreed cousins like gin and whiskey. This is a shame, because the naturally sweet, effervescent spirit is perfect for mixed drinks. Although the fraternity of tequila classics is small, the El Diablo could prove to be an underground contender. It has stood the test of time, wandering into cocktail books during the mid 1940’s, around the same time as the Margarita.\nGinger beer is a stand-out ingredient, and gives the recipe more than a passing resemblance to a Dark and Stormy. That comparison is skin deep however, as the El Diablo employs an offbeat and exciting assortment of ingredients, many of which should be combined more often. Tequila and creme de cassis make a brilliant couple, with the fruity tartness of blackcurrant playing excellently into the earthy bouquet of reposado tequila. Ginger makes a great third wheel, but needs to be spicy in order to be present. On the east coast, Reed's is a good option. In the Midwest, look for Vernors.\nGinger Ale, like any soda-pop, should be wielded with caution. The stuff is sweet and self-involved, with a tendency to grab the steering wheel and run off the road. It’s an elusive problem too, since a cocktail with too much pop will still taste pretty good. The problem isn’t about what is gained, but the subtlety that is lost. Most easy-going individuals will be perfectly happy with booze and pop, but rarely will they be truly wowed. Go easy on whatever ginger ale you use, adding no more than two ounces."

    "description": "El Presidente is an interesting cocktail. A whimsical bartender might describe it as something not unlike a dressed-up rum martini. Similar to other simple and delicate drinks, much of the preexisting literature on this recipe emphasizes detail through bottle selection. This is fine, and we’ll dive more into that in a minute, but even without perfection, El Presidente makes for a fun ride and a dastardly dry drink; it's great for moments when rum sounds best left to be rum.\nAccording to cocktail historian David Wondrich, El Presidente first hit paper in 1919, via an article in the New York Telegram. Supposedly named after Mario García Menocal—former president of Cuba and a well-known tippler—the cocktail found its best iteration at the famous Cuban cocktail bar El Floridita. Many of the cocktails on El Floridita’s menu were loosely translated and published in a cocktail book of the same name, before mid-century bartenders slowly worked them into the tiki canon. This might explain the drinks unfortunate “dark era” as a saccharinely sweet orange drink. Thankfully, most bartenders today make something not too far from the Floridita version, which generally leans quite dry.\nOnly four ingredients comprise El Presidente, and three of them are open to interpretation. Many modern recipes follow the advice of David Wondrich, swapping the dry vermouth for a slightly sweeter vermouth blanc, as the original recipe in Bar La Florida Cocktails requests. Dolin makes one, and Cinzano has a vermouth bianco that will work similarly well. Aged rum has replaced light rum as the preferred base for this drink. We have found that even with a traditional dry vermouth, aged rum rounds out the drink enough to make it very good (albeit very dry).\nOnly a barspoon of curacao is requested, and acts more like a bitter than a sweetener. El Floridita employed this trick with maraschino liqueur to similar effect on their now famous Hemingway Daiquiri. We like Pierre Ferrand dry curacao in this role, but have also read wonderful things about creole shrubb. Cointreau and Grand Marnier will also work, so don’t skip this drink just because of exotic labels. Some recipes recommend bitters, but we think curacao is enough. Please use real grenadine, and garnish with a cherry only on the best and worst days."

    "description": "Created by Lucy Hawkins and published in the awesome Nomad Cocktail Book by Leo Robitschek, el tigre is a fun and offbeat entry into the creamy drink canon. Puffed up by bubbly soda and a whole egg, this drink is reminiscent of the famous Ramos Gin Fizz. But the eccentric addition of aquavit and reposado flips that classic bubbler frame into an adventurous and modern year-round drink. The underutilized combination of creamy texture and floral tequila—something we’ve explored in house drinks like the dressing gown and stardust—is dear to our hearts, and it’s nice to see other bartenders exploring it. The unorthodox addition of aquavit is trendy but smart, as the anise flavors twist with the floral notes from the tequila beautifully and mimic the combination of juniper and rose found in the Ramos Gin Fizz. Whip up this complex cocktail to put a punctuation mark on a fancy holiday dinner, or to impress a cocktail fanatic, or simply as a new project for the long nights surrounding the winter equinox.\nLike the Ramos Gin Fizz, el tigre is a drink that operates at the intersection between a flip and a fizz. The amount of lemon juice you use will determine which direction your drink leans. The original recipe requests three-quarters ounce lemon, and sticking to this proportion will yield something closer to a sweet-and-sour fizz. Knocking the citrus back to a half-ounce will head more in the direction of a flip or egg cream. We alter the recipe based on the season; in the spring this drink works as a vibrant and sunny sour; in the winter a little less citrus makes for a modern twist on a winter nog. In the colder months we also like this drink with a bit of cinnamon on top, but it will compete with the scent of the aquavit. The original recipe is specific about base spirits. It requests Siete Leguas tequila, which we’ve never used but seems a bit expensive for such a complex recipe. Our mixing reposado tequila of choice is Cimarron, and it worked fine. It also requests Linie Aquavit, which is a good choice. Finally, a note on presentation: at around six ounces (including the requested ounce of soda) this drink is too small for a Collins glass, which typically comes in 10, 12, and 14 ounce capacities. If presentation is important for this drink, we recommend something smaller or a rocks glass, which looks nice half-full."

    "description": "Our friend Martin runs a wonderful and weird instagram that features retro recipes from midwestern community cookbooks. Items like “ice cream salad” and “potato chip cookies” are available for folks who might seek culinary adventure in that out-of-the-box kind of way inextricably associated with the 1950s. So it should come without surprise that when Martin requested a cocktail recipe from us, it would contain at least one ingredient that doesn’t belong in a mixed drink. Luckily the request, which was for carrot, was not completely out of the realm of sanity. In fact, carrot has become a bit of a trendy ingredient of late, and it was nice to finally explore the subject. Carrot juice is available at grocery stores of almost any size and—with its reasonable sugar content and beautifully vibrant hue—makes for a surprisingly effective mixer. Serendipitously, while perusing the pages of Mezcal by Emma Janzen we found this little ditty.\nWhile carrot juice might represent the biggest name on this billing, the show-stealer in this recipe is ground pink peppercorn: this offbeat ingredient adds a peppery and smoky flavor that pairs perfectly with the earthy-sweet flavor of carrot. Combined with mezcal and lime, the drink begins to look like a smart, short, and sophisticated version of a tequila bloody mary. Whip this drink out for brunch or whenever something salty, smoky, and savory is on the docket. Or reach for this drink when you’ve got some carrot juice and don’t know what to do with it. The beautiful orange hue contrasts with the speckled pink peppercorn for a show stopping appearance that will turn heads in almost any environment.\nWhen preparing for this drink, choose a mezcal with a salty and savory profile. We love the Mezcal Vago family and their Elote is a perfect fit. The original recipe requests only pink peppercorn on the rim, but we prefer a blend of pink peppercorn and sea salt. Take both of them and process in a spice grinder before applying to the rim. This will help knock the intensity of the pepper back a little bit and highlights the pink (rather than the less appealing brown) elements of the spice. We found that the cinnamon syrup didn’t come through with a lot of strength; if this flavor note is of particular interest, consider adding cinnamon to the rim or making a stronger syrup."

    "description": "Plucked from the overflow section of the book Cocktail Codex and created by Devon Tarby in 2016, the Endless Summer is an intriguing original that packs impressive summer potential. With loads of grapefruit jammed into each part of the sip, this drink will ultimately be divided between those who love the bitter citrus and those who don’t. Given the name, one might expect this drink to be sweet, but it is actually quite dry, citrusy, and floral with whiffs of pineapple and tequila. Any sweetness that does exist is provided primarily by the pineapple juice and curacao, making this a drink powered by fruit sweeteners more than cane sugar. That same fruit power also makes this recipe a perfect choice for daytime drinking, brunch, rooftop parties, or any summer celebration.\nThe endless summer will remind some of other grapefruity drinks like the brown derby, blinker, or 212. While it does share some elements with those recipes, the interplay between bitter grapefruit and sweet pineapple sets this one apart. Employ a generous peel for additional flavor and an awesome looking garnish. Pink grapefruit looks particularly fabulous. A dash of soda can amp up the summer vibes and add a touch of refreshing sparkle, but isn’t required. The drink is pretty sour, so if that isn’t your vibe, you could add a bit of extra sweetener. A sweeter orange liqueur will result in a more balanced drink, while a drier curacao will make for a more sour, fruity experience. We used Giffard creme de pamplemousse rose and liked the results, though several other interesting options are available. Blanco tequila is requested in this drink but we have also tried reposado tequila and liked it."

    "description": "The Erin is a pretty and balanced cocktail featured in Brad Thomas Parsons’ book Last Call. The book bounces around from bar to bar—some divey and others ritzy—all the while asking each bartender what they’d like to drink if it were their last. The colorful characters and historic bars steal the show, and many of the pros opt for something other than a cocktail. The Long Island Bar in Brooklyn is not on this list, and opts for the shimmering and sweet Erin cocktail, which head barman Toby Cecchini created spontaneously on request. “If I’m on my deathbed”, he wryly notes, “I’m sure going to have something strong. You’re looking back on your life, so I would want something strong, sweet, and bitter.”\nAt face value, the Erin is a good choice for evenings when the Negroni family stands out, but the old guard might seem a bit heavy and bitter. With a healthy portion of bitter suze and sweet china china amer, finished off with a few dashes of allspice dram, this drink has the skeleton of a Boulevardier but leans on the sweeter, fruitier side with lots of zesty peel. In fact, with not one but two peels and an orange-dominant amaro to back them up, this drink is an excellent choice for those who love the heavenly aroma of citrus, especially when paired with wintry spices. The Erin is also an excellent example of the mixing style peddled by many of New York City’s modern drinking establishments: so much so that for us, the aroma—balanced yet strong, with sparkling citrus peel and herbal gentian—brought back fond memories.\nThe original recipe calls for equal-parts of two vermouths: Cinzano Rosso and Carpano Antica. This specificity is not without warrant, as an overly sweet vermouth will push the drink out of balance. Fear not, home bartenders, as any semi-sweet vermouth will do, with spicier bottles faring best. Of course, if you are the sort who keeps multiple vermouths in stock, and just so happen to have both Carpano and Cinzano in stock, consider this moment a brush with fate. The original recipe also requests Suze: a bittersweet blonde apéritif with a heavy nose of herbal gentian. Suze is absolutely wonderful, and a must try, but we already had the excellent kina l'aero d'or from Tempus Fugit in stock and it worked beautifully. The original recipe also specifically requests Bigallet china china amer, though any liqueur in the amer picon family will do."

    "description": "In his book 3 Ingredient Cocktails, Robert Simonson briefly delves into the backstory behind his excellent Fair Harvard cocktail. To avoid tragedy in an all-white gallery, he spun up a crisp, clear riff on the classic he originally had in mind: the Harvard, which coyly honored the ivy school affiliation of the lecturer being celebrated. While the traditional Harvard has brandy and sweet vermouth, the “fair” version is a mix of pisco, bianco vermouth & orange bitters. The combination yields a drink that’s light—but with a classic feel—not unlike a Martini or Alaska. This recipe is a true “twist”, as it takes something very familiar, then turns it on its nose.\nThe Fair Harvard is a great opportunity to experience pisco, which can often be hard to work with but really sparkles here. The nose is full of fruity grape as well as nutty notes from the combination of pisco and vermouth. The sip delivers more pisco followed by a smooth, watery wash on the front of the tongue similar to what you would get from a martini. The finish is dry and mellow, though this might depend on how strictly you follow the original recipe. If you use the requested bianco vermouth, which is a touch sweeter than dry vermouth, the result will be smoother than if you use the more common dry vermouth. You can use dry vermouth and it’s ok— but it delivers a quality more like its classic relatives. Choose your pisco with care, as many are fairly acidic and difficult to mix with—we use Capurro Quebranta Pisco, which contained floral qualities that worked well here."

    "description": "While flipping through the pages of Selma Slabiak’s Spirit of the North, this drink’s sunny, floral presentation caught our eye, along with its use of a unique ingredient: pickled chamomile liquid. Regarding the name and inspiration, Slabiak notes that “Fionia is the Latin name of the island of Funen from which I hail—famous for its fertile land, golden summer meadows, and its mild, easygoing inhabitants”. The name and origin turned out to be perfectly apt, as this simple summery drink builds on an uncommon pairing of gin and sherry to create something fresh, bright and unique.\nThe Fionia's nose is full of vinegar and floral undertones from the shrubby pickled chamomile liquid and gin. Chamomile is a pretty subtle flavor, and it remains so here. First on the tongue is a sour sweetness from the pickling liquid that would likely appeal to shrub fans. Herbal tones from gin and chamomile follow, hanging around throughout. Dry sherry’s rich, nuttiness comes through on the finish to provide depth and balance. Sherry’s aged characteristics, alongside the vinegar-sugar solution’s sweetness, combine with the unaged gin to create the illusion of an aged gin, reminiscent of an old tom gin.\nPickled chamomile liquid is super easy to make, but as written in Slabiak's book, the recipe is quite large. To reduce the measure just follow the ratio of 2:2:1 if you don’t want to store significant excess. A strong vinegar flavor may not be for everyone, but don’t reduce the pickling liquid too much to avoid letting sherry take over. Slabiak’s recipe specifically calls for a dry amontillado sherry and we had great success with Lustau Los Arcos. The ingredient to play around with here is gin; a variety that amplifies the floral chamomile flavor will shine. Slabiak suggests garnishing with pickled chamomile buds, which would perhaps add more to the drink’s aroma, but fresh buds really deliver the summer vibes."

    "description": "The Schuylkill Fishing Company was founded in 1732. Not a company in the modern sense, but more a company of friends, it began on the 135-mile river that bore the same name, just outside the budding city of Philadelphia. It is the oldest angling club and longest-running continuously operated club in the United States. For our purposes, which are the most important kind of purposes, it is also the origin of one of the greatest American cocktails. For club associates, the fish house referred to a cabin on the banks of the river whose members and visitors—some of whom were presidents, generals, and politicians—would drop their credentials and help cook, clean, and make drinks.\nThe earliest versions of the recipe are a bit mysterious, probably because the drink was a carefully guarded club secret. The first published version came from Jerry Thomas’ landmark How To Mix Drinks, though the recipe was credited to Charles G. Leland, who was a member of the club and purportedly gave it to an editor of Wine Press. The original had tons of sugar in it; something that was later amended by the club and covered in the Philadelphia Times, who said the members had been forced to cut back on the sweetener due to “frequent attacks of gout.” Charles H. Baker published yet another variation in 1939 that used more peach, which most contemporary versions resemble.\nOur version of this drink is based on the recipe printed in Cocktail Codex, which takes Charles Baker’s interpretation and slims it down to a single portion; substituting peach liqueur for the now extinct peach brandy and replacing Baker’s request for spring water with soda water. Sporting a lemony nose and a big, rummy body with strong peach elements, this drink may be the ultimate sunny day sipper; something David Wondrich hilariously explains in Imbibe!, stating that it “deserves to be protected from law, taught in schools, and made a mandatory part of every fourth of July celebration, with dilute portions given to those not yet of legal age, so that they may be accustomed to the taste.” Beaming yellow in color, it hides all direct hints of booziness and—we mean this in the least condescending way—might taste like the best lemonade you’ve ever had.\nThis drink has undergone 300 years of modifications and is pretty perfect as is, so substitutes and alterations aren’t really necessary, though we might add that the nutmeg isn’t required. Depending on the season, you could substitute various stone fruit sweeteners: pear and apricot in particular. It is of course a punch, so you can also make it at a larger scale. Many recipes request putting the seltzer in first—this causes the drink to be a bit more mixed together than a traditional “top” method, though a quick stir will achieve the same effect. Cocktail Codex recommends a short shake when preparing this drink, which makes sense in combination with the seltzer and shouldn’t be ignored."

    "description": "Fruity and spiced, the flannel shirt is a complex cocktail that will remind some of a smarter, snappier version of a southern-style old fashioned, which typically involves a bit of macerated fruit and a healthy dose of Angostura bitters. The recipe was developed by legendary bar manager and spirits writer Jefferey Morgenthaler and published in his classic guide The Bar Book. Morgenthaler developed the drink to pair scotch with his own handmade blend of apple cider. For the sake of simplicity—and a mostly absent desire to replicate the average Saturday of George Washington—we bought our apple cider. But don’t let this deter you, ye of historically-minded pursuits; the recipe for Morgenthaler’s homemade apple cider can be found in the same book as this recipe. You can let us know how it goes.\nThe flannel shirt is a natural people pleaser with a nice velvety texture and a balanced, even body stuffed with flavor. The nose and initial sip are dominated by a fruity bouquet of apple, citrus, and malt. The second half of the drink shows off the recipe’s spicier side with strong notes of clove from the dram and various herbs from the amaro. The viscosity of the cider gives this drink a luxurious texture that binds all of the ingredients together into a single, perfectly balanced sip. While it might not appease the most adventurous of cocktail drinkers, this populist love bug is perfect for cozy winter evenings and boisterous game nights: just like it’s namesake garment.\nIf you don’t have Amaro Averna on the shelf, don’t worry. We really didn’t find that element integral to this drink in the same way Amaro Nonino is in a paper plane. Feel free to experiment with any bittersweet amaro that isn’t named Cynar or Zucca. This drink, like most, makes sense with a blended scotch that emphasizes malt over peat. We like Pig’s Nose and Monkey Shoulder best in this spot. This drink can benefit from a touch of smoke, but we prefer to achieve this with a splash of something like Peat Monster to finish. This will not only improve upon the drink, it will also save a bit of expensive whiskey for where it shines best: alone in a glass."

    "description": "The tiki approach to mixing base spirits generally goes like this: rum plus rum plus more rum. The fog cutter abandons that philosophy, and instead harbors an uncommon mix of rum, gin, brandy, and sherry. This combination may strike some as overkill, but it’s a handy recipe if you mean to clear the bar of near empty bottles. Fortunately, it also turns out to be rather tasty.\nDebate persists regarding who deserves rights to the original fog cutter, and varying recipes have graced the pages of different cocktail books. Trader Vic’s variation has stood the test of time and seems to win the popular vote, as well as ours. The drink shares a name with its companion: a tall, ceramic tiki vessel that serves as kitschy mascot to the faux Polynesian movement.\nMiraculously, the gin, brandy, and rum come together smoothly, creating a complex and refreshing seaside sipper. Be careful with the lemon juice; the fog cutter is not intended to be spiked lemonade. Start a bit shy of 2 ounces and add to taste. Orgeat and orange juice balance the drink with subtle sweetness, while the sherry float contributes nutty depth. Reach for a straw so you don’t gulp up all the sherry at once, and give it time to crawl through the ice and slip into every sip. This drink may not be as aggressive as the zombie, but we advise a similarly cautious consumption."

    "description": "The Ford first hit print in George Kappeler’s notable 1895 book Modern American Drinks. This predates Henry Ford and the founding of his namesake corporation by a little less than a decade. Ted Haigh speculates that it could be named after Malcolm Webster Ford, a famous athlete from a prominent family who was ultimately disinherited for his commitment to competition.\nThe recipe for the modern Ford looks a lot like the recipe for an 1800s martini, plus a little bit of Benedictine. Unchanged over the past century, while the martini changed a lot, the Ford has become its own drink, but only through the lens of time. This is the annoying thing about martini variations: cocktails like the turf, the tuxedo, the racquet club, and the Ford all came within an ingredient or two of one another, and were likely treated as relatively interchangeable until cocktail books in the 20th century attempted to pry them apart. Things like old tom gin aren’t a good differentiator either, since most gin drinks were made with old tom back then. It wasn’t until the dry gin revolution in the 1890s that cocktail books were forced to specify what type of gin to use, though most of them, including Kappeler’s book, stuck to old tom and holland styles.\nCall this a Ford if you want, or a fancy 1800s martini if you are feeling spunky. The important step is drinking it, which you will not regret. It's strong, herbal, and bitter, with pungent notes of juniper from the gin and herbs from Benedictine. The orange is subtle, and dominated by herbal notes on the nose, but finds its way into the drink at the back of the tongue. Deep and complex, this drink is sure to satisfy even the most stuffy of gin lovers. Like the martini, always use decent and unspoiled dry vermouth. If you aren’t interested in the orange bitters, consider lopping off a dash or two. They do make a big statement towards the end of the sip."

    "description": "Should the French 75 be served on the rocks, or neat? This controversy seems rooted in the mixture’s ambiguous heritage. It shares three ingredients with a Tom Collins, which is poured over ice. However, some early recipes call for brandy instead of gin, making it more akin to a Champagne Cocktail, which is always served neat.\nToday, the average bar serves a French 75 up. This might have less to do with craft and more to do with value and perception. Champagne isn’t cheap, nor is it traditionally served on the rocks, meaning many Americans might feel swindled having their bubbly over ice.\nUltimately, neither history nor perception matter too much. A French 75 is both a Champagne Cocktail and a Tom Collins, which is part of what makes it better than its ancestors. The whole ice thing is really a matter of preference, season, and type of wine. Champagne on ice is remarkably crisp and refreshing, while serving it up will put the bubbles and gin on the nose for a spirited, effervescent experience. Arnaud’s serves it up, but also makes a $14 cocktail with carefully selected Champagne. If you are working with Prosecco from the fridge in the dead of summer, ice might be a good look."

    "description": "Inspiring drinks commonly emerge from inventive bar programs stocked with an enviable array of exotic bottles. Further, these bars are often well positioned to concoct time consuming components perfectly formulated to complement these spirits. As a counterpoint, Maggie Hoffman’s The One Bottle Cocktail offers an approach ideally suited to the constraints of the home bar. The cocktail guide embraces these constraints as creative fuel, featuring recipes that highlight a single spirit or bottle and resourcefully turning to the pantry to fill in the blanks. Created by Nathan Shearer of Bar Swift in London, the French Canadian employs a simple mix of cognac, champagne vinegar, maple syrup, and vanilla, which Hoffman declares a “perfect proof of concept.”\nThe use of vinegar may strike some as odd, but vinegars are often hidden on menus as shrubs or gastriques. There’s also historical basis for its inclusion in cocktails: shrubs were a pre-colonial method of preserving seasonal produce, and were often combined with various spirits. While shrubs are relatively easy to prepare, they take a bit of forethought and we wouldn't assume the average home bartender has the time, so we rarely call for such ingredients; the one exception being the Fionia and its use of chamomile vinegar. The beauty of the French Canadian is the use of champagne vinegar, which offers a quick and spontaneous way to experiment with these flavors.\nThis drink will likely appeal to those who are familiar with shrubs or who love the flavors of sour beer, but truthfully not everyone is going to love this. The nose is full of vinegar and a hint of lemon peel. The sip is incredibly sparkly and engaging at first from the vinegar, with maple sweetness and nutty cognac most present afterward. A little heat from the cognac and a bracing vinegar finish partner with warm vanilla, which adds a nice balance. Champagne vinegar lies on the lightest end of the vinegar spectrum, allowing the rich flavors of its bedfellows to shine, while adding an acidity more complex than citrus. The drink cleverly highlights a diverse range of grape flavors, from champagne vinegar to cognac. Maple and vanilla play off each other to create a warm depth of flavor, with the vanilla standing out more than the maple.\nAs a drink designed around one bottle, spirit selection will make a significant impact, so use a good Cognac like Pierre Ferrand or Dudognon. If you’re feeling hesitant about the acidity of this drink, try going a little light on the vinegar to start. You can always add more to taste, and not all vinegars are created equal. Finally, please use real maple syrup. That bottle of log cabin hiding under the counter won’t provide the necessary depth of flavor for a cocktail."

    "description": "Historically, there are two Frisco cocktails: the Frisco and the Frisco Sour. The Frisco started popping up in bar guides sometime in the 1930s. One of its earliest appearances was in William Boothby’s World Drinks and How to Mix Them in 1934. Since then, the drink has evolved from a simple whiskey sprinkled with Benedictine and a lemon twist to a citrusy sour delight. Frisco recipes with lemon are arguably Frisco sours, but the sourless Frisco has essentially become obsolete. For anyone inclined to feel negatively towards the drink’s title, just tell yourself it’s a reference to the city of Frisco, TX. It’s a real place.\nThe Frisco is a smart riff on a simple and classic combination. There are various incarnations of this drink floating around, all of which are manipulations on the rye-Benedictine-lemon combination. You can thank Employees Only for the recipe printed here, which we think is the best. Lime adds something special, elevating it from a standard sour formula. Because the drink sticks to a conventional template, it allows the combination of lemon and lime to create interest. As a member of the sour family, it reminds us a bit of the Fog Cutter, which also employs the citrus duo to impressive effect. The hefty dose of citrus and Benedictine give it a subtle complexity that never feels complicated, and the cherry garnish adds just a touch of indulgence. On the nose it delivers a zesty lemon-lime combination with just a hint of spice from the rye. It has a balance and lip-smacking tart akin to the Sidecar. Herbaceous, medicinal Benedictine combines with rye for a satisfying blast of heat on the finish.\nThe Frisco is an everyday cocktail. Best of all, it can be made with a very small bar and limited ingredients. A standard mixing rye will work fine in this recipe. We like Old Overholt or Rittenhouse. We have made it with bourbon with favorable results, but if bourbon replaces the spicier rye, reduce the measure of Bénédictine to balance the sweeter whiskey. If a mouth puckering sour is not your style, some prefer a dash of simple syrup in this drink. Toss in a quarter ounce and find the balance you seek. Several recipes make this drink with just lemon juice, and people seem to like it just fine. We like the sophistication that comes from the combination of citrus, but don’t let that stop you from making this drink. For a true adventure, try substituting Chartreuse for Benedictine. As always make sure to use fresh lemon and lime (and make sure to save a slice of each for garnish before squeezing the juice). We tend towards minimalism in garnish, but in this case, the three fruits combine for a nice visual layering that adds a bit of interest to an otherwise pedestrian looking beverage."

    "description": "Gefion, sometimes spelled Gefjon or Gefjun, is a norse goddess associated with the plow and harvest. Folklore credits Gefion with the formation of the island of Zealand—one of the most fertile places in Denmark—by plowing away mainland that would fill with water and become lake Mälaren. This cocktail, which shares a name with the goddess, was created by Selma Slabiak, head bartender at Nordic restaurant Aska and it’s basement bar, Edda. In her book Spirit of the North Slabiak writes that “the ingredients in this drink pay homage to Gefion by using two grain spirits, the warmth of the amaro and honey syrup.” Warmth is a key player in this drink as the tandem base spirits propel forward a savory-sweet mixture not too distant from the classic gold rush, but with spicy and herbal elements that add intrigue and dimension. Slabiak suggests this drink after a long day, and we couldn’t agree more; each time we try it, we are impressed by the effortless complexity it doles out. Though the spicy elements were an early seller, the star of this show is the twin bases, particularly how the aquavit flatters the rye. As an added bonus, a long slice of cucumber makes for an unexpected and showstopping garnish, especially when twisted around the drinks orangish-red body.\nThis recipe requests Linie aquavit specifically, which is a cask matured version of the famous Norwegian spirit. Linie is much mellower than other variations of aquavit, and this specification likely contributes to the excellent support it gives the rye. That said, for many home bartenders two bottles of aquavit is one too many, and we certainly think this drink could work with a more typical clear variety; just consider going easy on it, as the herbal flavors of lighter variations are usually sharper. Don’t skip the cucumber, as it makes a significant contribution to aromatics and adds surprise and dimension. It would not be the same drink without it. Small scale Persian cucumbers work well. The original recipe calls for the drink to be served up, but we thought the workaday personality of the drink fit nicely over one large cube. Finally, the author notes that infusing the honey with herbs like rosemary and heather adds a nice touch: something we haven’t tried but certainly intend to."

    "description": "The Gentleman’s Exchange is a good drink with a lot of company; the cocktail landscape has little shortage of short brown whiskey drinks and this one does not veer too dramatically from the formula. Yet we are not the types to hastily dismiss a winning formula, and this cocktail—taken from the page of the Nomad Cocktail Book—does just enough differently to keep this winning formula feeling fresh. As an added bonus, this drink requires no squeezing, blending, crushing, or advanced thought sans a grapefruit peel that isn’t a prerequisite anyways. It’s also quite strong, placing it firmly in the evening line of work. Mix it up as a lazy nightcap or low-key party fare.\nThis drink has the approximate composition of a Manhattan but with the added perk of being served on the rocks and with a pervasive hint of coffee. Like the excellent revolver cocktail, the Gentleman’s Exchange leverages the impeccable combination of whiskey and coffee, albeit this time with rye rather than the revolver’s call for bourbon. Alongside the rye and coffee are cola notes from the amaro as well as little bits of anise from the absinthe. One of the magic elements of this drink is the way a single teaspoon of coffee transforms it: coffee is present at every level of the drink and this modest and measured dosage shines with restraint and balance. The Suze and amaro combine for a bittersweet finish that helps separate it from the revolver and reminds us a bit of the Long Island Bar’s Erin cocktail.\nThe original recipe printed in the Nomad Cocktail Book calls for several specific ingredients. Most notably, it calls for cold brew coffee, which we changed to coffee liqueur in our version. This was an easy substitution for us since we typically have coffee liqueur on hand—Mr. Black is our favorite—but it was not with strong intent and cold brew will work equally well. The original recipe also calls for Foro Amaro. As home bartenders we find requests for exotic amari a bit irksome and opted instead for the versatile and easy to find Amaro Averna, but again: if Foro is on hand do not hesitate to try it this way. The original recipe calls for Pernod absinthe, which is fine if not expected, but we prefer Absinthia, which has become our go-to as of late."

    "description": "At some point in everyone’s life, they will miss home. Bartenders, who often find themselves working in big cities far from the place they came from, are no exception to this rule. The Fionia—created for the island of Funen in Denmark—is one excellent example we’ve covered here, though we’ve seen countless others on menus while traveling. Gratefully, we’re able to add another wonderful piece of nostalgic storytelling to the list; the ghost coast is an unforgettable gem of a cocktail pulled from the pages of Spirits of Latin America by Ivy Mix. Created by Jesse Harris for Leyenda in Brooklyn, this cocktail is an ode to the beaches of northern California, where eucalyptus lines the forests above the sand. Even though we suffer no such nostalgia (we currently live about fifteen minutes from a eucalyptus lined beach) this drink is so elegantly evocative of one of the most beautiful places on earth, and so innovative in the way it captures the feeling of a place, it doesn’t matter. It is one of the best cocktails we’ve ever made, and undoubtedly worth the little extra effort required to create.\nThe crux of this drink lies in its use of eucalyptus tincture. This ingredient is the soul of the drink and cannot be skipped. Luckily, the tincture is extremely easy to make, so the only chore will be procuring fresh eucalyptus. Most flower shops will have some on hand, and we’ve been able to snag some from the floral department at grocery stores too. If all else fails, eucalyptus tincture can also be bought from Wal-Mart. The original recipe also calls for Giffard creme de banane; we’ve never tried the Giffard variety, but whole-heartedly recommend the Tempus Fugit version, which is irrevocably decadent and memorable with deep sugary flavors reminiscent of banana bread. You will be scouring for reasons to use it, we promise.\nThe drink itself is seasonally versatile, though we think it plays best on a foggy day in early spring: one reminiscent of the marine layer that so often coats the coastal redwoods in California. It starts off like a classic Margarita, with lime and agave on the nose with just a hint of banana bread and honey. On the sip things continue like a Margarita, with sour and sweet notes, before transitioning into a big bouquet of warm flavors from the maple, banana, and honey before finally ending with a big lingering herbal complexity from the eucalyptus. This finish takes the drink from good to great with a wonderful element of storytelling and surprise, the kind that will have even the most well-traveled cocktail drinkers saying “what is that?” Reach for this recipe when something new and adventurous is on the docket, or perhaps you simply miss a special place."

    "description": "The Gilchrist, plucked from the ever-inspiring pages of the PDT Cocktail Book, caught our eye with a somewhat bizarre and adventurous combination of wintery ingredients. It was created by Daniel Eun, who mixed at the book’s namesake bar, and christened after his old flute repairman, Bob Gilchrist. The book also notes that Gilchrist, like Ernest Hemingway, was diabetic. This might seem like trivia, but it helps demystify the strange recipe: the ratios are identical to a classic Hemingway Daiquiri. Of course, nearly every non-grapefruit ingredient is swapped out—but hey—a drink has to start somewhere, right?\nLots of cool weather drinks, especially those with Scotch, shoot for a fireside aesthetic. They are deeply spiced and spirit forward. On paper, the Gilchrist reads like it could be a similar recipe. Instead, it takes some cold weather ideas and spins them into a light, dry, and deeply transfixing drink. With a creamy tone and lovely, golden color, this surprising slurper slots perfectly into brisk fall days and early winter evenings. The pear and smoke lend wintery tones, while juicy grapefruit and sweet herbal amaro keep things light and balanced. The scent evokes a near-heavenly combination of fruity pear and peaty smoke.\nThis drink is very dry. Depending on your audience or mood, an extra quarter ounce of amaro or simple syrup might be a good idea. A blended Scotch is best in a drink like this, but a nice whiff of smoke is really awesome with the pear. A splash of Laphroaig or Pete Monster really hits the spot. There are several great types of pear brandy lining better liquor store shelves: we like St. George and Clear Creek. If you are looking for something a bit more exotic, we were recently turned on to the lovely F. Meyer Poire William. The original recipe requests a lemon twist for garnish, but we just love grapefruit peel in cocktails. Our recipe requests the pinker peel, but either way, it will be dominated by strong scents from the pear and Scotch, so don’t stress the decision too much."

    "description": "In the 1800s, scurvy tormented those who worked the high seas. It was known that citrus helped ward off this nutritional menace, but fresh fruit was susceptible to spoil and vermin. To combat this, juices were preserved in alcohol, but this had problems too: some workers didn’t drink, and those who did found the mixture unpalatable. Lauchlin Rose, who founded Rose’s in 1867, patented a method to preserve lime juice with sugar instead of alcohol. Because of its broad appeal, lime cordial became wildly popular with shipping companies and naval establishments.\nAs the story goes, the term Gimlet derives from the surname of British Surgeon General Sir Thomas Gimelette, who instituted a daily ration of lime cordial for active Navy members. Some stories claim Gimelette ordered the cordial be mixed directly into each tot of gin, but this seems unlikely. Forcing the cordial to be mixed with alcohol would negate one of its chief benefits: teetotaler friendliness. A more likely story is that Gimelette preferred to take his lime cordial with a bit of gin, which undoubtedly also proved popular with sailors trying to force down government liquor.\nLight, refreshing, and almost dangerously drinkable, the Gimlet is perfect for daytime events and easy-peasy celebrations. The simplicity of the recipe also makes it a great cocktail to tinker with, and a simple way to try out a new and exciting gin. It has a soft green hue with a milky, opaque consistency. It's a bit sweeter than a daiquiri, and has a double dose of lime from the infused syrup. The nose sparkles with juniper and fruit, and the sip opens with sourness, followed by smooth sweetness.\nThe original gimlet contained only lime cordial and gin, but today many recipes call for the combination of fresh lime and simple syrup instead. Excluding those seeking a sip of history, the version with fresh lime juice will taste better. The one downside to this variation is the absence of infused lime peel, which tastes distinctly different from juice, and is present in most lime cordials. Our favorite solution to this problem is from the PDT Cocktail Book: they use a quick and easy syrup infusion. We've taken that recipe, reprinted it here, and converted it to a size better for small bars. If you don't feel like making the infused syrup, don't let that keep you from making the drink; use plain 1:1 simple syrup instead. Many books recommend Plymouth gin in this recipe, but don’t hesitate to branch out. This simple old bird is fabulously open-minded."

    "description": "There are seemingly endless riffs on the classic Negroni, however the Gloria, found tucked amongst the pages of the Everleigh’s A Spot at the Bar, might just be the ultimate. The Melbourne based bar put to pen their “same but different” riff: a gin heavy adaptation of the Gloria Cocktail 2, borrowed from the 1947 edition of Trader Vic’s Bartender’s Guide. Trader Vic’s recipe calls for even measures of gin, Campari, vermouth, and orange liqueur—a pedigreed formula to be sure—but we find the uptick in gin slightly more balanced. This glowing amber drink is guaranteed to please fans of its classic kin, and will make an excellent addition to anyone’s regular nightcap rotation.\nWhile it maintains a similar essence to the Negroni, the simple swap from sweet to dry vermouth and addition of orange liqueur results in a much more inspiring riff than most. The nose opens with a combination of sweet and bitter orange. The mouth has a luscious body with medicinal notes. Everything is followed by a combination of orange and Campari, giving it a rich texture. Dry vermouth adds a kind of nuttiness, and emphasizes elements of the bitter aperitif that you might not get in other similar drinks. All of these flavors come together to produce an inexplicably caramelly characteristic. The finish is full of heat from lingering gin, solidifying its spirit forward status.\nThe Gloria is a great opportunity to use Bruto Americano as a substitute for Campari. The bitter aperitif brings a nose of forest and woodsier palate that pairs well with our go to French vermouth: Dolin dry. The strong juniper notes of a dry London style gin is just right for this formula. As with any spirit forward stirred drink, don’t neglect your stirring muscles."

    "description": "The gold rush is a simple riff on the classic whiskey sour. Created by T.J. Siegal, the friend and business partner of cocktail baron Sasha Petraske, this cocktail represents a keystone moment in the modern cocktail renaissance, and is now a bonafide classic mixed in bars around the world. As Richard Boccato notes in Regarding Cocktails, “The Gold Rush is one of the fundamental examples of the Milk & Honey cocktail program: three ingredients, perfect balance, and no fuss.”\nWe love this cocktail as a late summer sipper. The honey syrup and lemon combine for a bright, effervescent nose with a big wash of nutty bourbon on the finish. Its slightly opaque texture reflects light outward in a brilliant orange-gold hue, and a big chunk of ice looks handsome poking just above the waterline. Fans of whiskey gingers will adore this drink, as will bourbon lovers. Indeed, this drink is so simple, balanced, and delicious, we struggled to think of any reasonable drinker who wouldn’t like it. The excellent penicillin cocktail—another Milk & Honey classic—is based off this recipe.\nWe really like Four Roses in this drink, but then again, we like Four Roses in a lot of things. A sweeter bourbon might appease your aunt, but will probably lack enough complexity and heat on the finish to appease most cocktail drinkers. While this drink’s satisfying simplicity is an undeniable asset, we can think of several additions that might be good. A single dash of angostura bitters would compliment the bourbon nicely, and a small lemon twist usually looks good and rarely hurts, though a full peel might be too much for such a balanced drink."

    "description": "Since it will undoubtedly come up, let's address the matter on the tip of everyone's tongue first: no, our grasshopper isn’t green, and yes, the drink was named after the variety of insect that blends in with grass, not flamingos or cotton candy. There will be more on this subject briefly, so if your underpants are in a wad, feel free to skim forward. For everyone else, let's step back and dive into a little history. French Quarter mainstay Tujague’s claims ownership of the original Grasshopper or—more specifically—that Philibert Guichet created the drink during his tenure as owner of the restaurant while at a mixing competition in 1919. As is the case with many cocktails, much of this history is lore, but the bar and family do stand by the claim, and of course continue to sell grasshoppers by the boatload.\nThe grasshopper is a dessert drink, and is often derided as being for children, grandparents, or the childhood memories of grandparents. That last one seems like a joke, but it isn't: the current owner of Tujague’s mentions this specifically in an article for Eater. All of that said, with the proper ingredients, we have found this to simply not be the case. Yes, this drink has enough sugar in it to power an ant farm for years, but the bracing intensity of the mint, combined with the complexity of a quality creme de cacao, really makes for an unforgettable experience that can be appreciated by almost anybody, regardless of personal taste. The drink is big, balanced, and—even without the ice cream that some recipes call for—satisfyingly thick, cold, and creamy. Is it one step away from adult chocolate milk? Yes. Would we drink this all the time? No. But we can see why this drink, first brought back into light by Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s inspiring remix in 2013, is starting to see a legitimate renaissance,\nThe recipe selected here is adapted from a version printed in the awesome Meehan’s Bartender Manual. Our recipe makes a few alterations to bring the drink closer to home; most notably we omit the 8oz of Häagen-Dazs ice cream requested, as well as the single drop of green food coloring that gives the drink it’s famous hue. Originally, the green color came from cheap versions of creme de menthe colored with artificial additives. Bartenders have revived the drink with higher quality liqueurs produced by companies like Tempus Fugit and Giffard, but these producers smartly drop the unnatural coloring in their versions. There is nothing wrong with putting food coloring in a drink, and we certainly won’t judge you for adding some, but we've never used food coloring before, and aren't really inclined to begin on a drink that already looks like a milkshake. Besides, the grasshopper wears pink pretty well, and everyone will forget about the color once they take a sip of this confectionary magician anyway."

    "description": "Contrary to its name, there ain’t nothin green about this drink. The Green Glacier has been floating around the internet since Jamie Boudreau published it on his site in 2008. Inspired by the flavors of the comforting verte chaud, Boudreau created a richly potent drink that enabled him to “enjoy chocolate and Chartreuse all year long without even a sideways glance from the most discerning cocktail drinker.” Indeed the drink’s classic stirred amber glow dresses up delicious warm winter flavors, for a potently rich nocturnal drink that’s respectable enough for year round consumption.\nThe green glacier places chartreuse and creme de cacao on a rich base of brandy and accents it with bitters. The nose is full of orange and chocolate, with a quick whiff of chartreuse that hangs around on first sip alongside brandy, followed by a finish of creme de cacao and botanical heat. The result is sweet yet boozey, rich yet nutty, and chocolatey from brandy and creme de cacao. It reminds us of the Widow’s Kiss or even our Burl Ives cocktail with its spirit forward approach and strong chartreuse flavors.\nGreen Chartreuse is a must here; otherwise any color claims in the drink's title are moot. Be sure to use a good creme de cacao; the only creme de cacao that graces our bar with regularity is Tempus Fugit. We like a nice nutty cognac, such as Pierre Ferrand, in place of brandy, but some may result in an overly sweet drink, so make sure to try it first. If you are feeling sassy, you could certainly play around with the bitters: chocolate or orange would be complementary and amp up the confectionary flavors, but this drink could handle an assortment of ideas."

    "description": "When afforded the opportunity to use Amaro Montenegro, we rarely pass up the occasion. Such was the case while flipping through the pages of Sother Teague’s I’m Just Here for the Drinks and stumbling upon this beauty. The author, and amaro expert behind New York’s Amor y Amargo, Teague named the concoction in reference to the pairing of Montenegro with Cherry Heering. Confused? We can elaborate: Peter Heering, responsible for the world’s first cherry liqueur, was a Danish grocer (this is the groceries part), while Amaro Montenegro was named in honor of the marriage of Princess Elena of Montenegro to Prince Vittorio Emmanuele III, the future king of Italy (hence the queen bit). These two historic ingredients combine to produce a drink that is excellently suited as an introduction to amari. It is rich, juicy, and mildly bitter with a profile that appeals to any palate.\nMontenegro is a favorite among bartenders and for good reason: it is deliciously complex and only mildly bitter, which lends itself excellently to mixing. Only three individuals know the exact formula for Amaro Montenegro, which is made from a blend of 40 botanicals, including sweet and bitter orange, and nutmeg, cinnamon and clove. The resulting flavor is full of citrus, warm baking spice, and cocoa. Fruit and chocolate is a classic combination, so pairing it with Heering feels like a natural choice. Cherry and orange scent dominate the nose, with medicinal undertones from the amaro. More orange and cherry lead through the sip, followed by mild bitterness and complexity from the gin. The Heering is very prominent, resulting in something that tastes a like grown-up fruit punch. A light bodied gin will let the Montenegro shine, while the addition of chocolate bitters underscores the warm flavors from the Montenegro. The drink’s dark complexity and combination of heering, gin, and modifier reminds us most of the Remember the Maine, but it’s combination of amaro and tiki ingredients is not unlike another classic: the Jungle Bird.\nThe original version of this recipe—despite being a feature on Montenegro—was a little lacking on Montenegro for our tastes. We prefer it with an extra quarter ounce. As always, use fresh orange juice in your cocktails. The drink’s essential ingredients don’t leave much room for improvisation, however there are various chocolate, or similarly flavored, bitters on the market. We often use El Guapo Spiced Cocoa Tea Bitters when chocolate is called for."

    "description": "Unfortunately for us, we did not discover this drink while lying under palm trees on a dreamy island vacation at the eponymous Hawaiian resort where it was created; instead we stumbled upon it while lying on our couch and flipping through the pages of Shannon Mustipher’s always enticing Tiki: Modern Tropical Cocktails. What attracted us to this beverage was the promise of delivering all the tropical goodness of a tiki drink, but in a much shorter, more compact package.\nThe combination of Pineapple and bourbon is a secret weapon in the cocktail world, and here that combo works to perfection. Mustipher draws parallels to an amped up whiskey sour and—with its hefty dose of fruit—it reminds us of a Wisconsin style old fashioned. The drink delivers layers of fruit and spice: bourbon and pineapple are present from start to finish, with spice from the bitters on the nose and a nice wash of even more fruit at the end. The drink has a really nice yellowish orange opaque color, providing the perfect opportunity to break out the pineapple fronds for a fresh green garnish. It's fruity and caramelly flavors of pineapple—all in the sour style—brings to mind another excellent contemporary drink: the Sutter's Mill.\nMustipher recommends overproof bourbon: specifically Booker’s or Old Grandad 114, and we can see why that recommendation is a good one; the body of the drink is quite fruity and sweet so the high proof balances things out. That said, if you don’t have overproof on hand, any good bourbon will do. For a subtle tweak, we tried King Floyd’s aromatic bitters in this mix and it was exceptional, adding a lot to the nose of the drink. Use fresh citrus juice and high quality pineapple juice, and leave the old school cheap grenadine on the shelf, or even better: make it yourself. This drink is also easily scaled to a punch. Just follow the same ratios."

As the story goes, she crafted this cocktail to please a regular patron’s Martini habit, inspiring him to howl “By Jove! This is the real hanky-panky!” Looking further into the etymology of the phrase, it is not innuendo, but instead a “claim of trickery, deception, fraud, (or) hocus-pocus”. We aren’t certain this was a positive review, regardless, it caught on. Some cocktails gain popularity for their easy sipping, and some for their polarizing flavor.\nThe Hanky Panky is essentially a punched up Martini featuring the anything but subtle fernet: an amaro whose black licorice and menthol notes dramatically alter the simple classic. While searching for alternatives to the classic Fernet Branca, we stumbled across Fernet-Vallet. Perhaps less suited to sipping, this Mexican interpretation is ideal for mixing. This variation provides a slightly more subtle bitterness, further tamed by the sweet acidity of the accompanying orange. This is a drink for friends with adventurous tastes.\nProper stirring is essential to making the Hanky Panky palatable. Fernet will dominate other ingredients and requires a healthy dose of water for dilution and blending. A good, long swizzle will release enough water to yield a frosty, smooth, and much more enjoyable cocktail."

    "description": "Named for the oldest institution of higher learning in the US, the Harvard Cocktail first appeared in George J. Kappeler’s 1895 Modern American Drinks. Essentially a brandy Manhattan, the recipe was originally published as equal parts sweet vermouth and brandy, plus simple syrup and bitters, stirred and topped with seltzer. Often, Manhattan riffs tend to focus on simply replacing one ingredient, but this one thinks outside the box with the seltzer. It’s this simple departure from the common formula that transforms it from a lesser member of the Manhattan family into something exceptional, and a recipe worth retaining. The result is an interesting bubbly twist, more suitable to a long liquid lunch; perfect for the odd time when you’re kinda craving the classic, but are perhaps also enticed by a white claw. Less specifically, this drink is ideal anytime you want to tinker with brandy, and a great opportunity to show one off.\nSeltzer bubbles are immediately present on the nose, alongside brandy, and throughout the sip. The combination of two wine based ingredients makes for a double grape bomb: a strong fruity flavor, with a hint of spice from angostura. The bitters follow through on the finish alongside a hint of orange. The seltzer works well with all of the fruitiness; it lightens and brightens the heavy combination of brandy and sweet vermouth, making it much more drinkable. The combination yields a drink with the body of a Manhattan, but a much lighter, fruitier and less spicy variation. Sother Teague of New York’s Amor Y Amargo thinks the original was likely served with plenty of seltzer, in a style similar to a fizz, but instead chose to employ a 2:1 ratio of cognac to vermouth, with a small finish of seltzer—an approach we've embraced. Feel free to play around with vermouth. For an excellent and inventive twist on this classic, try Robert Simonson’s Fair Harvard."

    "description": "In 1939, Ernest Hemingway—exhausted from fame and a dissolving marriage—sailed to Cuba in his boat, Pilar. He rented a corner room on the fifth floor of a building in Havana, and became a regular fixture on the short side of the bar at La Florida, a popular restaurant. La Florida, or Floridita as the locals called it, was proud of its daiquiri. It had several variations, each delineated by a number (daiquiri num. 2, daiquiri num. 3, and so on). Hemingway didn’t like normal daiquiris because, quite frankly, he drank an incredible amount and thought the sugar slowed him down. Instead, he preferred something he called the Papa Doble: a frozen daiquiri with double the rum and no sugar. Over time, the head bartender began sprucing up Hemingway’s concoction with a splash of grapefruit and maraschino liqueur: a flourish they similarly employed on the house daiquiri num. 3. Today, when a bar serves a Hemingway Daiquiri, it is something closer to number 3. This is probably because Hemingway’s actual daiquiri—which was mostly rum and lime—would taste pretty gross.\nToday’s Hemingway Daiquiri is an excellent recipe. It captures the spirit of what Hemingway liked to drink, but with a balanced body and sociable portion of rum. Most modern versions request more than a splash of grapefruit, and that’s fine; the additional juice results in a cocktail that is smoother, fruitier, and more refreshing than its ancestor. It also means less of the rum will come through, and the grapefruit will cut into the lime a bit, notching down the infamous lip-smacking tart of the traditional style. We think this is an asset: where the classic daiquiri—boozy and nocturnal—thrives as a rum-lovers old fashioned, the Hemingway is mellow and easygoing: a great brunch drink, porch sipper, or general companion to any warm-month celebration. If multiple maraschino liqueurs are at hand, we recommend a less medicinal variety like Maraska. A clean light rum will work great here: something like Flor de Caña or Cana Brava, and of course: only use freshly squeezed fruit juice."

    "description": "If a dining establishment began serving plates of cinchona bark, mugwort, and wild gentian root, things might get weird. But with cocktails, people can be rather open minded, especially regarding things that are bitter, woody, or medicinal. This makes cocktails a great way to explore the scents and flavors of wild or natural places. For us, that place is often the mountains. As outdoor enthusiasts, the rustic, buzzing scent of woodland has always been a flavor profile we love to explore, particularly during colder months.\nWhite génépi are good mountain dwellers: gruff, hearty members of the Artemisia species described in The Drunken Botanist as “rugged plants, some only a few inches tall, that thrive in tough, rocky conditions.” Closely related to wormwood, the plants are used to make an alpine liqueur called génépi, which the same book notes “perhaps best captures the actual flavor of the herb”. The buds from this plant expunge a resinous and piney flavor, used as a focal point in this drink. Braced by gin, the cocktail is rounded out with a dash of wormwood infused dry vermouth, and finished off by another asterid, rosemary. It's a big, brash, and woody bouquet that feels as indulgently botanical as it does glacial.\nThe most widely available génépi is distributed by Dolin and has a sweeter, smoother flavor. Alternatively, Bittermens has begun distributing the French-made Guillaumette Génépi, which has a more resinous character and spirited bite. If you are using a sweeter génépi or want a drier drink, swap the simple syrup for an extra quarter ounce of dry vermouth. We recommend a New American gin for this drink, such as St. George’s Terroir or Death’s Door. The sprig of rosemary may be plunged underneath the cube before presentation. This helps keep the more pungent herb balanced with the sweeter and subtler nose of the génépi."

    "description": "Originally a pre-prohibition cocktail, the honeymoon has been rediscovered in waves. The recipe was first published in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 book \"Recipes for Mixed Drinks\", and was a featured drink at the Brown Derby restaurant in Los Angeles during the 1920s. We stumbled across the drink in Ted Haigh’s Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, and it gets a mention in the PDT Cocktail book too. Both recipes are nearly identical, differentiated only by the type of base spirit recommended. The honeymoon cocktail is essentially an apple brandy sour: a simple combination of apple brandy, curacao, benedictine and lemon juice.\nApple brandy is the foundation of this light, bright cocktail. It employs both Benedictine and orange liqueur, which might unfairly portray the drink as very sweet. Benedictine is syrupy, but is also complex and strong. This, combined with the use of a drier curaçao and a hefty two ounces of base spirit, will actually yield a complex, boozy experience. The drink’s fruity notes are complemented by the spicy Benedictine. Lemon juice provides a crispness, and even at a 2 to 1 ratio of liqueurs to lemon, the drink is nicely balanced.\nThis drink doesn’t need much tinkering, but throughout its history cocktail writers and mixers have championed both French calvados and American applejack. The apple flavor of the calvados tends to be much stronger and brighter than that of applejack. It adds substantial complexity to the flavor profile of this drink. However, this is a preference, and we encourage you to give this drink a try, whatever variety you may have on hand."

    "description": "In the middle of the 20th century, rum was popular with New England colonists for very practical reasons: it doesn’t spoil, is relatively caloric, and packs a bit of moral nourishment to boot. The Atlantic trade routes were humming then, making island rum cheap and plentiful. In his excellent book And a Bottle of Rum, Wayne Curtis explains: “Rum was not just a diversion; it was nutritionally vital to colonists who labored to coax a meager sustenance out of a rocky, stump-filled landscape and cold seas.” This drink was no doubt popular for such reasons, as it packs in a second calorically dense staple: butter. Like it's ancient kinfolk—the rum flip, the Tom and Jerry, and the Baltimore Eggnog, this mixture found guzzler's goblets long before writing about drinking was considered a worthy exercise, so little concrete documentation exists.\nWe based our recipe off of Jerry Thomas’s Bartender's Guide, published all the way back in 1862. Unlike many of the drinks in that book, hot buttered rum was old news by then, yet the recipe is still a classic and won’t disappoint anyone with a keen sense of history, adventure, and a need for winter warmth. We make our hot buttered rum with cinnamon and spices, an alteration that technically qualifies the drink as hot spiced rum according to Thomas' guide. That said, most folks dress up hot buttered rum this way nowadays, and for good reason. As David Wondrich humorously puts it in Imbibe, “this is a case where more is definitely more.” Many hot liquor-based drinks come off as astringent and thin, but the hot buttered rum has a secret weapon: fat. This lovable macronutrient helps smooth out the astringent qualities of hot liquor and gives the drink a thicker, heavier quality ready for fireside perfection. The flavor is like deconstructed butterscotch, with rich rum and caramel flavors folding into baking spice. It has a distinctly culinary feel.\nA good hot buttered rum is big in flavor and can accommodate alterations with ease. We’ve made it with both vanilla and cinnamon syrups to excellent results. Honey or maple could easily work as well and are worthy of a try. As for the rum, stick to something dark and caramelly. We like to add a dash of allspice dram: an idea we adapted from the Dead Rabbit version of this recipe. If you don’t have any dram, just add a bit of extra sweetener and some clove. If you are vegan, consider using coconut oil. Make sure to use unsalted butter, and doubly make sure to enjoy this drink hot, as this isn’t a beverage one wants to spend much time with at room temperature."

    "description": "This Cuban-born drink takes its name from the historic Havana hotel of the same name. The Hotel Nacional Special feels simple and classic like a daiquiri, but has the fun and complex flavors of many tiki drinks. A triple dose of fruit dresses up a rum base to produce a drink that’s smooth and sophisticated, yet fruity and refreshing. It’s perfect for those moments when you want a little tiki vibe, but aren’t interested in something two feet tall sporting sixteen ingredients.\nOn the nose, the drink offers an intensely fruity bouquet of pineapple, lime, and apricot. Up front, the sip is piquant from the lime and pineapple, and the finish is full of rum and apricot. The fleshy flavors from the apricot brandy linger, lending a bit of earthy complexity to an otherwise very flashy drink. Similar to the pago pago, this drink is all about pineapple; the tropical fruit gives the drink it’s creamy texture, frothy head, and rich luxurious mouthfeel.\nOur version uses fresh pineapple instead of juice, a move inspired by the Smuggler's Cove version, which interprets a recipe originally printed in The Gentleman's Companion. It’s a pretty sweet drink, so depending on your tastes, try knocking off a quarter ounce of syrup or adding a splash more lime to lighten it up a bit. The kind of rum you choose in this drink makes an impact. For a drink with emphasis on fruity flavors, try a black rum or a smooth aged rum. For those who want to taste rum in their rum drink (you can count us in) try something powerful enough to stand up to all the wild flavors. Smith and Cross, Pussers, or Hamilton Pot Still are all good options."

    "description": "We have the New Orleans based and Irish themed bar, Pat O’Brien’s, to thank for the popularity of the hurricane. Developed in the 1940s, this drink quickly became a tiki bar staple, but these days it is much easier to find its unnaturally bright red imposter, whose metallic pouches containing hurricane mix can be obtained from every corner store in NOLA. With a short, packet-free ingredient list, the original hurricane is refreshingly simple for a tiki drink: something like a big rum sour or a minimalist Fog Cutter. Despite being really simple, there aren't many things quite like this drink. It's boozy, with tart fruity depth and sour notes atop a heavy dose of ice. Passionfruit syrup adds a surprising amount of fruitiness and complexity, given that it’s the only ingredient besides rum and lemon. The icy, amber toned beverage is served in a tall, large capacity glass unique to this cocktail. The result is perfect for rainy spring days, when you’re stuck on a balcony waiting out the weather.\nThe hurricane is a great opportunity to experiment with different rums. The recipe provided here, which is borrowed from Smuggler’s Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, and the Cult of Tiki, calls for black blended rum. Any good Jamaican or Guyana black blended will work, but feel free to play around with what’s on your bar. We like Hamilton 86, Goslings is easily acquired, and Lemon Hart 80 would be delightful as well. If you desire a sweeter more traditional tiki drink, the dose of syrup could be increased.The nose provided by the combination of cherry and lemon peel complements the drink well, but feel free to get creative with garnish. As for passionfruit syrup, which may be a bit uncommon, we suggest trying BG Reynolds for a proper tiki mixing syrup. This drink needs heavy chilling, but we prefer to skip the complications of a blender. Our preferred approach is to combine the ingredients with a hefty dose of ice and shake like crazy, then pour into a frozen glass overflowing with crushed ice."

    "description": "Plucked from the pages of Mezcal by Emma Janzen, the Apium—or Opium as it is also casually referred to in the book—plays on the savory and salty side of mezcal. It’s a fun and unique variation on the margarita that explores more untraditional flavor profiles natural to mezcal. At first blush it smells a lot like a margarita, with wafts of smoke and agave along with savory notes from celery bitters. It is limey on the front of the tongue and finishes with mezcal, salt, and smoke. Reach for this as a fun and sophisticated alternative to the margarita or as a salty and vegetal adventure that plays equally well under blue skies and warm breeze or a cozy evening at home.\nThe original recipe calls for celery salt, but we made do with a basic sea salt. This salt is not rimmed around the glass so little preparation is necessary—though you might want to grind coarse salt a bit in your fingers while dropping it in. We tried a couple different mezcal and found Mezcal Vago espadin had notes of brine and saltwater that perfectly complemented this drink, although any espadin mezcal will do. Stay away from more floral mezcal however, as they don’t work well with the celery bitters. Speaking of which: Fee Brothers, Scrappy's, and Bitter Truth all make excellent versions of this iconic savory bitter, with Fee Brother’s costing the least. As with many things, you get what you pay for, but we use the cheap stuff without embarrassment."

    "description": "Despite being listed first in the iconic Savoy Cocktail Book, the abbey arrives without a lot of documented history. It’s an archival void easily overlooked, since this delightfully smooth sipper plunks perfectly into boozy brunch menus, afternoon parties, and other extracurricular excuses for daytime drinking. Whatever the origin, employ this lovable classic as a detour from mimosas, corpse revivers, and other obvious brunch fare.\nThe abbey is a gleefully balanced drink, padded with a hefty margin of orange juice and Lillet, then finished with a mellow dosage of gin, soft enough to please your great aunt Bertha. Juniper notes poke through the orange, while Lillet adds a bit of depth and sophistication, elevating the drink beyond a simple screwdriver. Fresh orange juice responds nicely to being shaken, and gives the drink a toothsome texture and a bright, pretty color.\nTry a smooth, mellow gin here, as anything too big on botanicals might tangle up with the orange flavors. Don't bother with anything other than freshly squeezed orange juice, and make sure to strain it in a fine strainer, since the pulp can impact the measurement. Any light aromatized wine will work, but we've tried several and like Lillet best. If orange bitters seem a bit obvious, try Peychaud's bitters instead. Shake well over ice pellets, strain into a cocktail glass, and drop in a cherry for garnish."

    "description": "The blinker is an odd bird. It resides in the same neighborhood as offbeat classics like the Japanese, Seelbach, and between the sheets: recipes that don’t really make sense on paper—and maybe don’t make perfect sense in a cocktail glass either—but work just well enough to bring the adventurous drinker on a fun and weird ride. Perhaps a better comparison might be the lion's tail, since they both contain whiskey and unlike some of the aforementioned, are not only interesting, but really good too.\nOriginally published in The Official Mixer’s Manual, a somewhat exotic 1934 text by Patrick Gavin Duffy, The Blinker might have drifted off into history had it not been illuminated by Ted “Dr. Cocktail” Haigh in his 2009 book Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails. The good doctor mostly kept the recipe intact, but made one significant change: he subbed in raspberry syrup for grenadine. He argued that in the 1930s, grenadine and raspberry syrup were often treated as interchangeable, and raspberry syrup, well, tasted better. Since then the blinker has gained a steady reputation as a raspberry drink; so much so that some recipes associate the raspberry ingredient directly with the 1930’s original, skipping Haigh's alteration altogether.\nIt has become very popular to use raspberry jam or ice cream syrup for this drink. Haigh’s version is open ended, simply requesting “raspberry syrup”, but Chuck Taggert has confirmed several times that Haigh does indeed make the cocktail with the store bought stuff, so that is probably where the trend began. We have always found the best raspberry syrup is homemade. It is probably closer to what Duffy would have used (Smucker's products are mostly corn syrup) and exudes the heavenly taste of fresh berries. If the idea of a produce department frightens you, Small Hand Foods has an undoubtedly excellent raspberry syrup in their repertoire. The original version of this recipe does not specify a garnish, but we like to make it the way our favorite bar back in Brooklyn made it: with a generous grapefruit peel."
